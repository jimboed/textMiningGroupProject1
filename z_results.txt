 Oil giant ExxonMobil, already fighting a climate-related investor fraud case in New York, has been hit with a second lawsuit: The Massachusetts Attorney General is accusing the company of defrauding investors and threatening the world economy. 
 This newest legal blow landed Thursday in Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston in a complaint alleging  Exxon  repeatedly violated the state's consumer and investor protection law and related regulations.  
 The lawsuit accuses Exxon of a broad sweep of misconduct that includes using deceptive advertising to mislead consumers in the state about the central role its fossil fuel products play in causing climate change, and intentionally misleading Massachusetts investors about material climate-driven risks to its business. 
 Beyond the fraud allegations, Attorney General Maura Healey also upbraids Exxon in the lawsuit for an on-going "green washing" marketing campaign that she says falsely touts the company as a leader in clean energy research and climate action.

 The lawsuit further calls out Exxon over "hypocritically touting itself as an exemplary environmental corporate steward" when the company is among the largest corporate contributors to global warming. 
 "Collectively, as with its historic and ongoing deception campaigns about the science, the objective of ExxonMobil's efforts is to preserve the company's short-term profits in a carbon-dominated world economy no matter the dire long-term consequences for the company's investors or for the consumers who buy its products," the  211-page complaint  states. 
 Exxon did not respond to a request for comment. The company has 20 days to formally respond to the state's complaint in court. 
 "Exxon has known for decades about the catastrophic climate impacts of burning fossil fuels—its chief product," Healey said in a prepared statement. "Yet, to this day, Exxon continues to deceive Massachusetts consumers and investors about the dangerous climate harms caused by its oil and gasoline products and the significant risks of climate change—and efforts to address it—to Exxon's business." 
 "We are suing to stop this illegal deception and penalize the company for its misconduct," she said. 
 Defrauding Investors and Consumers? 
 The Massachusetts complaint opens a second legal front against Exxon at a time when the company is defending itself in  a New York courtroom  against a potentially multi-billion judgment in a financial fraud case being prosecuted by that state's attorney general's office. 
 Unlike the New York case, which rests exclusively on investor fraud allegations, the Massachusetts case more broadly includes consumer fraud allegations based on Exxon's failure to fully disclose information that would have allowed consumers to make informed decisions to purchase Exxon oil and gasoline products. 
 It takes aim at Exxon with generally the same claims made by New York prosecutors, including misrepresentations in its use of proxy costs analyses of company assets and its projections of future oil and gas demand. 
 The New York case rests on allegations that Exxon fraudulently  used two sets of books  to estimate the risks it faced if governments took action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, an alleged bookkeeping sleight of hand that prosecutors say exposed investors to greater risks than Exxon had disclosed. 
 The Massachusetts allegations also focus on whether past statements Exxon made questioning climate change science and downplaying its risks to the company constituted a form of fraud against the public and its shareholders. 
 "In service of the same effort to deceive the company's investors regarding the catastrophic risks of climate change, ExxonMobil also has deceived investors with misleading statements about how it incorporated climate change risks into its financial and business planning," the Massachusetts complaint says. 
 An Impact on the Global Economy 
 The complaint alleges Exxon hid from investors its  decades-long knowledge  that fossil fuels would have a negative impact on the climate and of the systemic financial risk that climate change would have on the global economy and to Exxon's fossil fuel business. 
 "In the coming decades, these catastrophic 'systemic' impacts threaten to impose ruinous societal costs, cascade throughout the world's economies, and decimate the overall value  of the world's financial markets, and with them, ExxonMobil's global business and the holdings of the company's Massachusetts investors," the complaint says. 
 It also denounces Exxon's portrayal of itself as a leader in cutting-edge clean energy research and climate action while the company is ramping up fossil fuel production and spending only about one-half of 1 percent of revenues on developing clean energy. 
 "ExxonMobil's representations in its advertising and promotional materials that consumer use of its Synergy and 'green' Mobil products reduces greenhouse gas emissions are highly deceptive, since ExxonMobil fails to disclose the fact that production and consumer use of such transportation fuels is a leading cause of climate change that endangers public health and consumer welfare, and thus any purported environmental benefit associated with the use of those products is illusory," the complaint says. 
 What Exxon Knew, and Years of Court Battles 
 The complaint credits media disclosures, in part, as the foundation for the litigation. The genesis of the case came in the wake of a 2015  investigative series by InsideClimate News  and later stories by  the Los Angeles Times  that disclosed that Exxon had long understood the science of global warming and the role fossil fuels played in accelerating climate change. 
 Healy and then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman opened  investigations into Exxon  within six months of each other in 2015 and 2016. 
 New York fired  the first legal salvo with a 2015 subpoena  of Exxon seeking a sweeping array of documents laying bare the company's business practices. Six months later, Healy's office hit the company with  a similar request —known as a civil investigative demand—seeking records back to 1976 outlining Exxon's understanding of fossil fuels and their impact on global temperatures. 
 Those investigations provoked  a furious fight-for-its-life response  by Exxon that  played out in federal courts in Texas and New York , where Exxon sought to derail the investigations, claiming the investigations were politically motivated. 
 A federal judge in New York  rejected Exxon's request  to block the investigations and scoffed at the company's claim that the attorneys general were a part of a conspiracy to rob the company of its First Amendment rights and silence its views on climate change. Exxon has appealed the ruling. 
 Exxon took its fight against Healy's investigation  all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court  where it was rebuffed without comment. 
 The Massachusetts lawsuit was filed just hours after a judge rejected Exxon's last-minute attempt to halt the filing. The legal flurry erupted earlier this month after the attorney general's office  notified Exxon  that it is preparing to file its case. 
 Exxon sought to block the filing,  claiming the attorney general violated state law  that requires prosecutors to allow a potential defendant to present their side of the case before a lawsuit is filed. Exxon said it has had no substantive contact with prosecutors in years and had no opportunity to refute any possible allegations. 
 "The attorney general's race to the courthouse has nothing to do with the sound administration of justice or the rule of law," the company argued in its emergency motion. "It has everything to do with gamesmanship and unfairness that is unworthy of the chief legal officer for the commonwealth." 
 Healey's office called Exxon's move a  "blatantly obstructive tactic"  to try to stymie its case. It said the company has had ample time to meet with prosecutors.

 In only the second climate change trial in the U.S., Exxon Mobil goes to court Tuesday accused of defrauding shareholders and the public. New York's attorney general brought the suit, which alleges that the oil giant misrepresented how carbon regulation would affect the company's financial outlook.   The case goes back to 2015, when stories by  InsideClimate News  and the  Los Angeles Times  found that while Exxon's scientists were inwardly researching climate change to plan its operations, the company was outwardly casting doubt on global warming.   Those reports spurred investigations in New York and Massachusetts, which may file its own suit. "There's nothing wrong with advocating for your own company. What you're not allowed to do is commit fraud," then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman  told   PBS   NewsHour .   The case is before the New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan and is being prosecuted by Letitia James, who was elected state attorney general last year.   New York argues that Exxon used two different ways to calculate carbon costs and wasn't clear when it was using one or the other.   
 
   "Exxon provided false and misleading assurances that it is effectively managing the economic risks posed to its business by the increasingly stringent policies and regulations that it expects governments to adopt to address climate change," the state wrote in a complaint last year.   "Instead of managing those risks in the manner it represented to investors," it says, "Exxon employed internal practices that were inconsistent with its representations, were undisclosed to investors, and exposed the company to greater risk from climate change regulation than investors were led to believe."   The lawsuit claims that this had the effect of making Exxon's assets appear more secure than they really were, which in turn affected its share price and defrauded investors.   That would be a violation of a New York statute known as the Martin Act, which grants the state's attorney general the authority to pursue investigations and actions against those it suspects of securities fraud. It's the same law that has been used by previous attorneys general in the state to bring charges against big financial firms.   "There's not a general law, for better or worse, against lying in general, but there is a law against lying to shareholders," says Michael Gerrard, a professor at Columbia Law School and director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.   He says one focus in the case will be Exxon's investment in the carbon-intensive Canadian oil sands, a project that some  investors  worried won't make financial sense under tougher climate regulations.   While the details get a little wonky, the case could have big consequences.   "This is the first case on alleged securities fraud about climate change ever to go to trial," Gerrard says. "Many others have tried to bring such cases, but this is the first one that has gotten this far."   He notes that Exxon fought for years to prevent the case from reaching trial.   Exxon says the lawsuit is politically motivated and driven by anti-fossil fuel activists. The company says it was honest with shareholders about how it calculated carbon costs.   Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey sent  a letter  to Exxon on Oct. 10 stating her intent to pursue an action against the company for violations of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. Bloomberg first  reported  the letter last week.   Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil and other oil companies face a growing  number  of  lawsuits  that seek financial help in coping with climate-driven floods, drought and heat.   The New York case may ease the path for those other cases. Because New York's Martin Act allows for broad pretrial discovery, Exxon had to turn over hundreds of thousands of pages of documents to the attorney general's office, "and their complaint reflects that level of detail," Gerrard says.   The case goes before Justice Barry Ostrager, who has limited the trial to three weeks and said he'll issue a decision within a month after that. It could feature one very prominent witness: Rex Tillerson, who was chief executive of Exxon before becoming secretary of state in the Trump administration.

Theodore Wells, the lawyer for Exxon, exits New York State Supreme Court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., November 7, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The case, filed in October 2018 in Manhattan state court, was the first of several climate-related lawsuits against major oil companies to go to trial.  It featured testimony from investors, experts and former Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, who denied the allegations against the company.  New York’s attorney general alleges that Exxon caused investors to lose up to $1.6 billion by falsely telling them it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business. A verdict is expected within the next 40 days.  Exxon’s lawyer said on Thursday the case was “meritless” and that the state failed to offer testimony from any investor who was misled.  “The case is almost a joke,” Theodore Wells said. “But it’s a cruel joke, your honor, because the reputations of a lot of people have been hurt and disparaged by the bringing of the complaint.”   A lawyer for the state said the case came down to whether Exxon had adequately disclosed the cost of climate change.  “The question here isn’t whether Exxon employees are good people or even were trying their best,” Jonathan Zweig said.  Related Coverage Factbox: Lawsuits over climate change proliferate across the United States He told the court that the state was dropping two of its four fraud claims and would limit its closing argument to claims brought under the Martin Act, a law that gives the New York attorney general’s office broad power to pursue securities fraud cases without having to prove intent to defraud.  “The question in this case is whether Exxon’s disclosures were accurate, and the evidence shows they were not,” Zweig said.  The attorney general has said the company used a “proxy cost” of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions in wealthy countries by 2040, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all.  Tillerson testified that the proxy cost represented “macro level” assessment of the likely effect of future carbon regulations around the world on demand for fossil fuels, and was incorporated into a data guide used throughout Exxon.  Separately, he said, the company evaluated greenhouse gas costs at a “micro level” for specific projects, when appropriate.  Wells said the attorney general’s case wrongly conflated proxy costs with those separate, project-specific costs.  Last month, just two days after the New York trial began, Massachusetts filed a similar lawsuit accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.  Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying company scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.

Theodore Wells, a lawyer for Exxon Mobil, leaves New York State Supreme Court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 23, 2019.  REUTERS/Jefferson Siegel The lawyers’ opening statements kicked off a long-awaited trial in a civil lawsuit filed by the attorney general last year accusing Exxon of defrauding investors out of up to $1.6 billion.  The trial, expected to last up to three weeks, will take place before Justice Barry Ostrager in Manhattan Supreme Court without a jury and could feature testimony from Rex Tillerson, who served as Exxon chief executive officer and U.S. Secretary of State.  It is the first of several lawsuits currently pending against major oil companies related to climate change to go to trial.  The attorney general sued Exxon in October 2018 under the Martin Act, a New York state law that had been used primarily to go after financial fraud.  The lawsuit claimed Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a “proxy cost” of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all.  “Exxon only ever told its investors about a single set of assumptions,” Kevin Wallace, acting chief of the New York Attorney General’s Investor Protection Bureau, told Ostrager Tuesday.  “What we are saying, and the law demands, is that Exxon not mislead its investors,” he said.  Theodore Wells, a lawyer for Exxon, said that after Tillerson became chief executive in 2006, the company put in place a “robust system” to manage the risk of increasing climate change.  He said the $80 per ton proxy cost represented a “global,” “macro level” assessment of the cost, while lower figures, known as greenhouse gas or GHG costs, were used for particular capital projects.  “There is no document that says ... proxy costs and GHG costs were one and the same,” he said.  Wells also accused former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of bringing the case for political reasons.  “They didn’t stay in their lane of objectivity and fairness,” he said.  Massachusetts is separately investigating whether Exxon concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change.  Slideshow  (5 Images) Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying company scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Those reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.

 By Karen Savage 
 The second week of Exxon’s climate fraud trial in New York Supreme Court wrapped up last week with testimony by the head of Exxon’s auditing team at  PricewaterhouseCoopers , who said he used the terms greenhouse gas cost and proxy cost interchangeably in memos written prior to 2017. 
 That revelation came from Exxon’s first witness, Richard Auter, head of the Exxon auditing team at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC). He was called by Exxon’s lawyers after the New York attorney general’s office rested its case after eight days of testimony by its witnesses. 
 New York’s lawyers are attempting to prove  that Exxon violated the state’s  Martin Act  by failing to disclose it used two different sets of numbers to assess climate risk, one for shareholders and the other for its own internal calculations. As a result, Exxon shareholders suffered losses totaling between $476 million and $1.6 billion, according to the AG’s office. 
 Auter’s testimony went right to that issue. “I did not appreciate the distinction of using the words greenhouse gas cost and proxy cost,” he testified. 
 Investors have  testified  that Exxon misled them to believe that it used only one number when assessing how climate change would impact the future of its business.  
 Exxon is expected to call several witnesses in its defense. Following Auter to the stand on Friday was Exxon’s former vice president for corporate strategic planning William Colton, who will resume his testimony Monday. Other witnesses will  include current and former employees and experts in corporate finance, accounting and securities law.   
 Exxon has not denied using two different numbers, but  maintains  it properly disclosed how it used them. The company finally aligned those two numbers, the proxy cost of carbon and greenhouse gas cost, shortly after the company released its 2014  Energy and Climate  and  Managing the Risks  reports to shareholders. It says its publicly shared proxy cost of carbon was used to project global energy demand, while its greenhouse gas cost was a proprietary internal number used to evaluate investment opportunities. 
 Exxon contends the alignment of the two numbers was based on the world’s progress on climate change and its anticipation of a global agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.  
 In its defense, it will likely address notes embedded in an internal presentation indicating it had “implied” in its 2014  Energy and Climate  and   Managing the Risks  reports to shareholders that it  used  its proxy cost of carbon when evaluating investments. 
 Exxon will continue to try to discredit the AG’s argument that the company’s Canadian oil sands assets, which at the time accounted for about 25 percent of its total resource base, were at a much greater risk from climate change than previously understood. The AG presented emails and documents that it says shows Exxon disregarded the newly aligned number in order to inflate the value of those assets. Witnesses for Exxon will likely reiterate its contention that the greenhouse gas cost listed its DataGuide, an internal planning document, was only a guideline to be used when exact regulatory costs are unknown.  
 Under the Martin Act, the AG does not need to prove Exxon intended to mislead its shareholders, only that it did and that investors would have considered that misinformation to be important to their investment decision.  
 Auter’s lack of clarity regarding terms for the two numbers seemed to support the AG’s contention that Exxon misled investors by using the numbers interchangeably, however the bulk of his testimony revolved around the oil company’s 2015 impairment testing of its Mobile Bay gas field. 
 Exxon attorney Justin Anderson asked Auter about an assessment by Eli Bartov, a financial expert and witness for the AG. Bartov  concluded  that had the company included greenhouse gas costs in its testing, the gas field would have been impaired in 2015. 
 Auter told the court he has seen nothing in the AG’s investigation and subsequent lawsuit that would change PWC’s conclusion, which was that it does “not take exception” with Exxon’s conclusion that its Mobile Bay asset had not been impaired. And he said even if it had been impaired, the impact would have been minimal relative to the size of the company. 
 After Bartov’s testimony, the AG had called another expert, Peter Boukouzis, a former energy mergers and acquisitions investment banker and current business professor at the University of St. Katherine. He said the increased risk to Exxon’s assets is  apparent  when the greenhouse gas costs in Exxon’s financial models are aligned with the publicly disclosed figures.  
 Boukouzis told the court that to make that determination, he used spreadsheets containing economic models that Exxon was forced to turn over during the AG’s investigation. The only change he made to the models was to insert the proxy cost of carbon disclosed in the  Energy and Climate  and  Managing the Risks  reports.  
 The results revealed some of Exxon’s assets were not as valuable as shareholders—or company management—had been led to believe, Boukouzis testified. 
 “These models are building blocks in corporate planning and in investment planning,” Boukouzis said, adding that the resulting data was likely used by Exxon’s management committee, including ex-chief executive  Rex Tillerson , when making key investment decisions.  
 The overly optimistic asset values, as well as its assurance to investors that it was managing the risks of climate change, caused Exxon stock to become overvalued, Boukouzis told the court. He said investors who purchased stock at the higher prices suffered losses when the prices eventually fell.   
 If the AG’s allegations are proven true, the fraud could cost the company dearly. The state has asked the court to hold the company liable for between $476 million and $1.6 billion in shareholder losses. It is also asking the court to order an examination of Exxon’s past and future accounting methods and to appoint an independent monitor to supervise the process. 
 Ostrager has given Exxon until Nov. 12 to conclude its defense and has said he will issue a ruling within 30 days of the trial’s conclusion.

 The New York attorney general is taking ExxonMobil to trial in a historic case Tuesday, accusing the oil giant of misleading investors about the company’s financial risks due to climate change. Under the direction of Attorney General Letitia James, this is the first climate fraud lawsuit to go to trial in the United States. James is acting under New York’s Martin Act, a  1921 anti-fraud law  meant to protect investors against false statements, even ones made without proof of intent to deceive. The historic lawsuit comes as more and  more legal action  is being taken against Exxon and other fossil fuel companies by cities and states seeking to hold them accountable for their contribution to climate impacts. The trial, which will take place before the judge and not a jury, will begin Tuesday at 2:15 p.m. EDT in the New York Supreme Court, and could last up to three weeks. Climate activists plan to rally outside the court ahead of the trial to draw attention to it. It is possible that Exxon’s former chief executive Rex Tillerson, who left the company to serve as President Donald Trump’s initial secretary of state, could testify. New York’s investigation previously revealed Tillerson used a  second secret email address  as the company’s CEO. New York prosecutors began their investigation about four years ago and sued Exxon last October. Under the direction of Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who later  resigned amid a harassment scandal , in November 2015 New York issued its first subpoena to Exxon demanding documents on the company’s internal accounting on climate risk. The investigation followed parallel investigations by  InsideClimate News  and the  Los Angeles Times  showing how the oil company’s own researchers confirmed that fossil fuels have contributed to global warming in the 1970s and 1980s. (Subsequent reporting  revealed  oil researchers were studying climate change back in the 1950s.) The information about Exxon’s climate research threw the company’s later efforts to cast doubt on climate science and fund misinformation campaigns into sharp focus. “Exxon has been working very hard to prevent this day from ever happening,” Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told BuzzFeed News. They’ve brought lawsuits in both federal court and state court to halt or delay action on the investigation, and waged a public relations campaign, he added. The allegations, explained The crux of this Exxon case hinges on whether they were keeping “two sets of books,” said climate activist Kert Davies, who helped expose Exxon’s past funding of climate denial. This would portray climate risk to shareholders “differently in public than they are behind closed doors.” The New York attorney general declined to comment, instead pointing BuzzFeed News to a  pretrial memo filed on Oct. 7  that spells out Exxon’s alleged deceit. In anticipation that governments would adopt aggressive new climate policies including charging companies for their climate pollution, such as carbon dioxide, Exxon said in public disclosures that it was accounting for how a warming world threatened the business. Specifically, Exxon disclosed to investors “that it was applying a cost of carbon approaching $80 per ton across its business to account for that risk,” per the memo. “But ExxonMobil did no such thing. For many years, ExxonMobil’s undisclosed internal guidance directed its employees to apply a far lower cost of carbon than the company purported to use.” By claiming to use a higher carbon cost than it actually was, “ExxonMobil made its assets appear significantly more secure than they really were, which had a material impact on its share price,” according to the memo. The New York attorney general estimates the damage to Exxon shareholders ranges from about $476 million to $1.6 billion. At trial, Exxon is expected to acknowledge it had two sets of carbon costs but will argue investors should have known this and how the different prices were used based on disclosures. “Reasonable investors who reviewed ExxonMobil's disclosures understood that climate risks factored into ExxonMobil's decision-making, which is all that could have mattered to them. Those investors also understood that ExxonMobil did not disclose the proprietary details about how it weighed those risks,” the company  wrote in its own pretrial memo . Moreover, the company accuses the New York attorney general office of finding “no evidence of wrongdoing.” Company spokesperson Scott Silvestri told the  Los Angeles Times  the investigations into Exxon were “politically motivated and resulted from a coordinated effort by anti-fossil fuel groups and contingency-fee lawyers involved in other lawsuits against industry.” Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 What’s at stake? If Exxon loses this case, they’ll have to pay damages to the state of New York. But the company has to worry about more than a payout and a hit to its reputation. Exxon could also face additional legal challenges from other states, and possibly even at the federal level, according to Mark Latham of Vermont Law School. The fallout could impact many other companies, too. “It’s a big deal,” said Latham, adding that any company “that generally downplayed the risk of climate in public documents they disclosed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and others” would be at risk of future litigation if Exxon loses. Lawsuits on lawsuits on lawsuits Thematically, the case is similar to the  “public nuisance” cases  filed by cities and states against Exxon and other energy companies over the costs of climate change, David Bookbinder, chief counsel of the Niskanen Center environmentalist think tank, told BuzzFeed News. But the New York case only involves Exxon’s conduct after 2010. “That’s very different, and might be critical,” said Bookbinder, who was the chief climate counsel for the Sierra Club in the 2007 Supreme Court case,  Massachusetts vs. EPA , that ruled carbon dioxide was a pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act. In 2015, the New York attorney general settled with Peabody Energy, a coal company, over its public pronouncements that it was  unable to forecast  the impact of future environmental regulations on its business. At the same time, the company was shown to be making those forecasts internally and withholding them in their filings. The case is seen as a template for the Martin Act case against Exxon. “Documents have a tendency to lead to other documents,” said Bookbinder. “It’s possible the documents in this case might tell us about what companies earlier knowledge before 2010, which might play a role in the other lawsuits looking at earlier times.” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey has also been investigating whether Exxon deceived investors on climate risk, and is looking to soon take legal action of its own,  according to Bloomberg Environment . In an  Oct. 10 letter , the state attorney general’s office wrote Exxon to alert them the office “intends to commence an action against ExxonMobil for violations” of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. The company is trying to delay Healey’s efforts and  reportedly accused her team of distracting  the company while it prepares for the New York trial. Exxon’s checkered climate past By the late 1980s, every major oil company understood the risk of global warming was coming, and that its advent promised regulations imperiling investments in fossil fuels, science historian Spencer Weart, author of  The Discovery of Global Warming , told BuzzFeed News. “They made a decision then, the wrong decision, to discredit an entire scientific discipline, climate science, and by extension all physical science, rather than tell investors and everyone else the truth,” Weart said. Internal Exxon memos have shown the company’s marketing strategy involved publicly casting doubt on the science, such as placing a full-page advertisement in the New York Times titled “ Unsettled Science ,” according to the new report “ America Misled ” by climate communication and historian researchers from George Mason University, Harvard University, and the University of Bristo l . Meanwhile, the company privately funded climate denial campaigns, bankrolling  advocacy groups  that sought to cast uncertainty over climate science, even after pledging to stop funding climate deniers. “We know that this was deliberate,” Naomi Oreskes, a professor of the history of science at Harvard University and co-author on the recent report, told BuzzFeed News by email. “Given multiple opportunities to correct the record, they declined those opportunities, and continued business as usual.”

New York’s attorney general sued Exxon Mobil on Wednesday, claiming the company defrauded shareholders by downplaying the expected risks of climate change to its business. The litigation, which follows more than  three years of investigation ,    represents the most significant legal effort yet to establish that a fossil fuel company misled the public on climate change and to hold it responsible. Not only does it pose a financial threat to Exxon that could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, but it could also strike a blow to the reputation of a company that has worked to rehabilitate its image, framing itself as a leader on global warming. The suit does not charge Exxon with playing a role in creating climate change, though the burning of fossil fuels is a major contributor to human-driven warming. Rather, it is a fairly straightforward shareholder fraud suit, the kind that New York attorneys general have long brought and successfully prosecuted under state law. It says the company engaged in a “longstanding fraudulent scheme” to deceive investors, analysts and underwriters “concerning the company’s management of the risks posed to its business by climate change regulation.” Exxon essentially kept two sets of books when accounting for the effects of climate change, prosecutors said. The company told the world that it was prepared for the more stringent regulations that would inevitably be required to combat global warming. But in reality, according to the complaint, Exxon’s internal estimates discounted the potential future costs of climate policies, even though the threat of government action “exposed the company to greater risk from climate change regulation than investors were led to believe.” New York Attorney General’s Lawsuit Against Exxon Mobil “Exxon provided false and misleading assurances that it is effectively managing the economic risks posed to its business by the increasingly stringent policies and regulations that it expects governments to adopt to address climate change.”

 The investigation has spanned the tenures of two New York attorneys general and has also involved attorneys general from other states. Exxon has attempted to block the inquiry in courts in three states, and has painted it  as an attempt by bullies to restrict the company’s First Amendment rights  and as part of an anti-fossil-fuel conspiracy backed by, among others,  the Rockefeller family . Scott J. Silvestri, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said Wednesday that the New York attorney general’s office had “doubled down on its tainted, meritless investigation by filing a complaint against Exxon Mobil.” The “baseless allegations,” Mr. Silvestri said, “are a product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general’s inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing. The company looks forward to refuting these claims as soon as possible and getting this meritless civil lawsuit dismissed.” Barbara D. Underwood, the New York attorney general, brought the lawsuit under the Martin Act, a state law that gives her sweeping powers to investigate and prosecute securities fraud. The suit demands that Exxon turn over all the money it made through the alleged fraud and make restitution to investors.  Image Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood of New York.  Credit... Todd Heisler/The New York Times “Investors put their money and their trust in Exxon, which assured them of the long-term value of their shares, as the company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions,” Ms. Underwood said. “Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing.” The investigation  first came to light in November 2015 , about a year after it was begun by former Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman. Before long,  other state attorneys general announced their support for Mr. Schneiderman’s efforts;  some, notably  Maura Healey  of Massachusetts, started investigations of their own. The lawsuit says that Exxon told investors that when it was planning for its oil and gas reserves, its investments and its estimates of demand for its products, it applied an added cost, or “proxy cost,” that represented the likely effects of future climate regulations. But in many cases, the suit says, the company “applied much lower proxy costs than it represented or no proxy costs at all,” which exposed Exxon to greater regulatory risk. Prosecutors added that “Exxon’s fraud was sanctioned at the highest levels of the company,” including by its former chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. Tillerson, who went on to serve as President Trump’s first secretary of state, “knew for years that the company’s representations concerning proxy costs were misleading,” according to the complaint. Exxon has been the focus of other legal actions and inquiries over its past statements and its role in the public debate over climate change. Echoing the New York case, the Securities and Exchange Commission  opened an investigation in 2016  over the company’s practice of not writing down the value of oil reserves in light of the risk of climate change regulations, as other energy companies do.  The commission dropped that inquiry  in August. Also,  several cities, counties  and the state of  Rhode Island  have sued the fossil fuel industry to recoup the costs of dealing with sea level rise and other effects of a warming world. Those cases rely on creative and relatively untested legal theories, however, and  some of the suits , including  one filed by New York City , have been dismissed, though the plaintiffs have said they will appeal. Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family fund, which supports holding fossil fuel companies accountable for climate damages, said of Ms. Underwood’s lawsuit: “Apparently, Exxon has deceived the investing public about the economic consequences of climate change, just as they deceived the general public about the ‘catastrophic’ harm they knew their products would cause. It’s past time for Exxon to make their investors whole and to pay its fair share of the massive damages communities across the nation now face.” Internally, Exxon has acknowledged climate change’s effects on its operations and planned accordingly.    The company has long conducted research into climate change, much of it published in the scientific literature. In 2015,  Inside Climate News  and  The Los Angeles Times  reported that Exxon was well aware of the risks of climate change and used that research in its long-term planning for activities like drilling in the Arctic, even as it funded groups from the 1990s to the mid-2000s that denied serious climate risks. The company  pledged to stop funding groups  that directly challenged the science of climate change in the mid-2000s, and  says today that it accepts the science  and the need for action to blunt the worst effects.  The company supported the Paris climate deal  and opposed the decision by Mr. Trump to withdraw from the agreement. It also publicizes its development of  renewable energy technologies such as biofuels . In addition, Exxon recently announced it  would spend $1 million over the next two years  to finance a group promoting  “carbon dividend” legislation  that would tax carbon dioxide emissions and then return the money that is collected back to taxpayers. (The proposal that the company supports  would also protect companies  that emit fossil fuels from lawsuits over the effects of climate change.)  The New York lawsuit poses “a real risk to Exxon’s reputation,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. He said it was especially concerning for investors, who rely on the company’s statements. “If Exxon has been misleading on this,” Mr. Burger said, “what else has it been misleading about?” For more news on climate and the environment,  follow @NYTClimate on Twitter .

                    Exxon is accused of misleading investors about the potential cost of financial regulation
                 
 
 An unprecedented climate change lawsuit against American oil giant Exxon Mobil is set to go ahead in New York. The state has accused the company of misleading investors about the potential costs of climate regulation to its business. Exxon says it shared the necessary information and the claims are politically motivated. The case is at the forefront of a rising number of legal actions faced by oil and gas firms. Exxon's trial on the fraud claims will start on Tuesday and is expected to last 15 days. Former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who led Exxon for a decade, is among those likely to appear in court. 
 
 
 
 "It's a major milestone as a part of a growing wave of cases that Exxon and other major oil companies are facing, not only here in the United States, but in fact in jurisdictions around the world," said Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law. Fraud claims New York's attorney general filed the financial fraud suit in 2018 , after years of investigation by state authorities. In court filings, the state says internal documents show Exxon evaluated new projects based on forecasts for costs associated with climate change that were lower than those it told investors it was using. Those calculations made investments appear less risky and more valuable. "By representing that it was applying higher projected carbon costs than it was actually using, ExxonMobil made its assets appear significantly more secure than they really were, which had a material impact on its share price," the state wrote.

 Exxon does not dispute the claims that it used two calculations to evaluate the cost of potential  regulation.  However, the firm argues that those calculations were "proprietary" and investors were not misled. "Reasonable investors who reviewed ExxonMobil's disclosures understood that climate risks factored into ExxonMobil's decision-making, which is all that could have mattered to them," it says. Legal experimentation Activists pressed Exxon for years to be more transparent about how climate change affected its business, partly due to hopes that accurate estimation of the financial risks would shift money to more sustainable alternatives. Analysts said the New York case is an example of the kind of experimentation occurring as governments seek to hold companies accountable for climate change. The state of Rhode Island has filed claims against Exxon and BP, citing damage along its coast. Authorities in the Philippines and Canada are investigating fossil fuel companies as well. In recent weeks, the attorney general in Massachusetts has indicated plans to proceed with a case that accuses Exxon of deceptive marketing.  "Regardless of the outcome [of the New York case] the reality that is clear and not inescapable is that the future of Exxon and [other fossil fuel] companies is filled with litigation and it's only going to grow." Mr Muffett said.

It is a place where critical legal battles have been fought for nearly a century. Yet, as proceedings began in a modest second-floor courtroom on a gray, unseasonably warm afternoon late last month, the storied building somehow felt outmatched by the gravity of the matter at hand. 
 Two legal teams were crammed shoulder to shoulder around wooden tables. Spectators and curious out-of-state attorneys filled the benches behind them. Reporters hunched over their laptops. A tattooed court officer strolled the periphery of the room looking for rule-breakers. If you squinted, it could be any of the many high-profile trials that come through New York City and not — as many hope it will be — a historic test of whether the industry responsible for setting humanity on a path to immolation can be held to account before it’s too late. “The failure of the international community to strongly grapple with climate change and the rollbacks under the Trump administration are leaving advocates of strong climate action desperate for whatever tools they can use.” The case was the People of the State of New York v. Exxon Mobil Corp., which concluded last week. It is part of a wave of litigation directed at the titans of the fossil fuel industry making its way through courts across the country. “It’s only the second climate-change case ever to go to trial in the United States,” Michael Gerrard, a Columbia Law School professor and one of the world’s leading experts on climate liability litigation, told The Intercept. “And it’s the first where the plaintiffs were able to obtain discovery from any of the fossil-fuel companies.” Should New York Attorney General Letitia James succeed in the case, Exxon Mobil could be on the hook for up to $1.6 billion in damages. 
 “The failure of the international community to strongly grapple with climate change and the rollbacks under the Trump administration are leaving advocates of strong climate action desperate for whatever tools they can use, so many are resorting to the courts,” Gerrard explained. The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, which Gerrard runs and is aimed at training future climate litigation lawyers, has tallied the filing of 1,000 climate change lawsuits in the U.S., but the trend, he said, is not confined to the U.S. “We’re seeing an upswing in climate litigation,” Gerrard said, “not only in the U.S., but globally.” 
 On paper, the Exxon Mobil case in New York was not about the climate crisis — at least not directly. Instead, the suit was about representations Exxon made to its shareholders about potential future costs related to the crisis. Those representations, the attorney general’s office claimed, were false and amounted to an enormous case of securities fraud. “We are not telling Exxon how to run its business,” prosecutor Kevin Wallace told Justice Barry Ostrager in his opening statement. “It was and is always free to change its business practices, but it has to be honest with investors.” Wallace stressed that “the company failed to manage the risks in the way it promised. The costs of that failure are staggering. Investors are now entitled to the truth and their recompense.” 
 It was the careful framing of a prosecutor angling to win a case, but there was clearly more to the trial than that, a deeper explanation for the electric feeling running through Ostrager’s courtroom. There was a reason for the long line of people trying to get into the room that afternoon, and it was not some newfound, mass public interest in complex securities fraud litigation. People were drawn in because a seemingly untouchable corporation at the top of the industry responsible for the climate emergency was facing potentially serious damage in a publicly observable fashion. And it was not the only one. 
 As reporters stood  in line waiting for opening arguments to begin in New York,  news broke  that the Supreme Court had rejected a plea from more than two dozen multinational energy companies, Exxon Mobil included, to block a state-level lawsuit filed by the city of Baltimore — one of more than a dozen filed by state and local governments across the country. The suit is one of several “public nuisance” cases with the potential to open the fossil fuel industry up to liability for its climate impacts in individual localities and communities. The following day, as witnesses in New York began to testify, the Massachusetts attorney general’s office filed  its own lawsuit  against Exxon Mobil — an even more sweeping case than the one unfolding in lower Manhattan. 
 There’s an interconnected history running through the widespread litigation. “There was a prior round of these cases around 2008 and 2012 and they were all ultimately dismissed,” Gerrard explained — cases like American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut, Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp, and Comer v. Murphy Oil USA. “So, there was a hiatus of five years before the new suits began again under different theories.” Those theories benefited from the groundbreaking work of journalists at  InsideClimate News , the  Los Angeles Times , and the  Columbia School of Journalism , who published a series of stories in late 2015 based on a trove of internal company documents and dozens of interviews describing how Exxon “conducted cutting-edge climate research decades ago and then, without revealing all that it had learned, worked at the forefront of climate denial, manufacturing doubt about the scientific consensus that its own scientists had confirmed.”  react-empty: 217  A month after the stories broke, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman  subpoenaed  Exxon Mobil for “extensive financial records, emails and other documents.” Soon after, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and the Virgin Islands announced that they would be joining New York in investigating the company. “It’s too early to say what we’re going to find,” Schneiderman said at a March 2016 press conference about the investigation, which included support from attorneys general from across the country. “We intend to work as aggressively as possible, but also as carefully as possible.” 
 Exxon’s pushback was immediate and intense. The oil giant said the inquiries were “politically motivated and based on discredited reporting by activist organizations.” The company made efforts to  block the probes . And the pressure had an effect: Three months after announcing that his office was joining with New York and Massachusetts, the attorney general for the Virgin Islands  withdrew  his subpoena for nearly four decades’ worth of Exxon documents. 
 Among the measures Exxon took in response to the investigations was to hire Ted Wells, one of the nation’s most prominent white-collar defense attorneys, whose clients have ranged from I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby — the former adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney — to financial giants such as Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan.

Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP Tall and bald, with a voice that carries, Wells zeroed on Schneiderman’s 2016 press conference in his opening statement in New York, describing it as the extension of an “agenda to vilify ExxonMobil falsely.” “Your Honor, I know at the end of the day, you will base your decision on the four-corners of the complaint, but I think the question in everybody’s mind is the elephant in the room: Why would they do something like this?” Wells told the court. “They did it because they didn’t stay in their lane of objectivity and fairness. They got confused. Eric Schneiderman took them into the wrong lane. And I hope they get back ultimately into the right lane.” 
 When the news of the state lawsuits first emerged, there was an expectation that the New York case would be the broadest, Gerrard explained, with the pattern of public misrepresentation revealed through investigative journalism at its center. Instead, the attorney general’s office opted to pursue a  narrower securities fraud case , with its most powerful legal tools rooted in the Martin Act, an anti-fraud law that grants prosecutors sweeping authorities to investigate publicly traded companies. Described by Climate Liability News as “ the strictest anti-fraud law in the nation ,” the Martin Act does not require prosecutors to establish proof of fraudulent intent. The law was the basis for a New York attorney general investigation in the early 2000s that led to  $1.4 billion  in fines extracted from some of the financial sector’s biggest banks. 
 Instead of New York, the Massachusetts Exxon Mobil case has to date offered the nearest example of a broad targeting of the fossil fuel company that many had expected. Attorney General Maura Healey’s  211-page complaint  accused Exxon of “systematically and intentionally” misleading “Massachusetts investors and consumers about climate change.” Citing the journalism that revealed Exxon’s “pattern of deception” in 2015, the complaint went on to argue that the “gravity of ExxonMobil’s historic and continuing unlawful actions cannot be overstated; the world lost 40 critical years to develop and deploy new technologies that would allow an orderly transition away from fossil fuels. ExxonMobil’s deception deprived investors and consumers of the central facts so essential to their investment and purchasing choices: the knowledge that continued investment in ExxonMobil’s fossil fuel business and production and use of ExxonMobil’s fossil fuel products would bring about cataclysmic outcomes for humankind, many of the world’s species, and the global economy.” 
 The New York and Massachusetts cases are the high-profile face of “a multi-pronged attack on the fossil-fuel industry,” Gerrard said. He added, though, that “it’s far too early to predict how all of this will play out.” Gerrard declined to speculate on which of the various legal challenges companies like Exxon might be most worried about: “They’re very vigorously defending all of them.” 
 To Bill McKibben,  the environmentalist author and founder of 350.org, the current moment feels like the start of a new chapter. “We’re at the very beginning of what will be a long, official reckoning for one of the really astonishing crimes of our time,” McKibben told The Intercept. “The underlying offenses started a very long time ago, the very end of the 1980s and the 1990s, with the decision to build this architecture of deceit and denial around whether climate change was real — a question that the oil companies knew full well the answer to.” “We’re at the very beginning of what will be a long, official reckoning for one of the really astonishing crimes of our time.” While reliance on the courts can be a tricky thing for activists — “because they’re out of your control in the end” — McKibben highlighted one case in particular as deserving of “special credit” in this moment of heightened legal action: Juliana v. United States. 
 Known as the “climate kids” lawsuit, the case was filed in 2015 on behalf of 21 youth plaintiffs. Juliana differs from the other major climate cases playing out in New York, Massachusetts, and elsewhere: It sets its sights on the government,  arguing  that through its actions to permit, authorize, and subsidize the fossil industry — while at the same time understanding the catastrophic harm that industry was causing — the government violated the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and failed to protect them under the doctrine known as public trust. 
 The legal rationale behind the litigation was developed Mary Christina Wood, a law professor at the University of Oregon, whose  theory  of “Atmospheric Trust Litigation” argues that the legal canon of public trust — the idea that the government must protect critical environmental systems for the public good — should also apply to the atmosphere. Thus, the government would be required to pursue actions that will protect, rather endanger, the environmental well-being of future generations. Join Our Newsletter Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. I’m in On November 10, 2016, two days after Trump’s election, Ann Aiken, a federal judge in Oregon,  denied  a government motion to dismiss the case. “I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society,” Aiken said. Since Juliana’s filing, plaintiffs have filed similar lawsuits in courts across the country. Three state-level cases have been dismissed, leading to appeals. 
 Whether Juliana will succeed is uncertain. The case is currently tied up in the courts, with the government continuing to fight for its dismissal. Environmental activists are watching the litigation as closely as any in recent memory. If it does succeed, implications for the fossil fuel industry could be historic. 
 “It’s done an enormous amount to educate,” McKibben said. “And it’s gotten further than I think a lot of people thought it would when it first began. Great credit to them.”

Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images From the beginning,  the climate cases have drawn comparisons to the Big Tobacco litigation of the 1990s. It’s easy to see why: Both involve major corporations systematically lying to the public about the danger of their products and attorneys general acting in response. At Schneiderman’s 2016 press conference, former Vice President Al Gore himself drew the comparison, saying that “the analogy may hold up rather precisely.” The two historic cases even share a character: Wells, the attorney for Exxon,  defended Phillip Morris  when the company was accused of running its own multidecade deception campaign. 
 Understandable though they are, Gerrard cautions that the analogies between the Big Tobacco cases and the current climate cases have their limits. “The plaintiffs in the climate cases constantly compare them to the tobacco cases and they hope that they will turn out the same way,” he explained. “The major difference is that society does not need tobacco in order to operate, whereas fossil fuels are a basis for modern civilization.” To get around that fact and combat the climate crisis in a meaningful way, Gerrard argues that society must move to a decarbonized economy, one where the fossil fuel is no longer a basis for civilization — and to do that will require efforts that go beyond the courts. 
 The state rested its case in the New York Exxon Mobil trial late last week. In doing so, prosecutors dropped two of their four fraud charges. The claim under the powerful Martin Act was not one of them. Wells, the Exxon attorney, described the “meritless” case as a “cruel joke.” A verdict is expected in December. 
 The most high-profile witness to take the stand during the multiweek affair was former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, who oversaw the company for a decade before embarking on a one-year stint as  secretary of state  under President Donald Trump. 
 If Tillerson was unnerved by the questions from the attorney general’s office, he didn’t show it. Dressed in a navy blue suit and a red tie, the longtime oil man explained how Exxon takes climate change seriously and had in fact spent years researching the issue. He left out the parts about the company keeping its critical findings secret while waging a disinformation war to undermine outside climate science that was coming to the same conclusions. 
 In recent years, Tillerson told the judge, Exxon has laid claim to the “largest and most diverse resource base in the industry,” with a total of 92 billion barrels of elemental materials under its control — 25 billion in proven reserves, 28 billion in the design or development stage, and 39 billion in the evaluation stage. When it came to the climate crisis and how it would impact Exxon’s overall strategy, its day-to-day operations, and its obligations to shareholders, Tillerson said, “We tried to be responsible.” 
 At the same time, he acknowledged, “We are in the depletion business.” 
 “The climate crisis is so enormous, and the change so vast, that we need huge progress on every front.” What will become of that business — knowing what the public knows now about the role it played in shaping the present and the future — is the underlying question running through the climate litigation in the courts right now. 
 “The climate crisis is so enormous, and the change so vast, that we need huge progress on every front,” McKibben said. In a recent  article  for the New Yorker, the veteran climate writer argued that sustained focus on the financial community that sustains fossil fuel industry — specifically the banking, asset management, and insurance sectors — should be one of those fronts. Those struggles, McKibben contended, cannot be disentangled from the fights playing out in the courts. “It’s clear that CITI and Chase and BofA and Wells Fargo” — major financial institutions — “are lending hundreds of billions of dollars to these guys, knowing full well what they do in the world. That seems outrageous,” he said. “We need big political change. We need the judicial system hard at work. I think, fervently, that we need real, powerful engagement with the financial community — engagement being shorthand for attack on the financial community that is bankrolling all of this stuff.” McKibben quickly clarified himself, with a laugh: “Nonviolent attack. But a spirited one nonetheless.” 
 A largely unspoken implication ran through much of Tillerson’s testimony in Ostrager’s crowded New York courtroom: the idea that in the decades to come there will be a role for companies like Exxon to play, one that’s positive and not a direct and active contributor to the crisis, as it has been for the last 40 years. McKibben has his doubts. “I’m not at all sure that they’re ever going to be part of the solution, but if they are, it will be precisely because they were hammered as hard as you could possibly hammer them,” he said. “Their political power needs to be broken before there’s any chance that they’ll be a force for even modest good.” 
 “Breaking their political power,” he said, “is a sine qua non for progress on any front.” Wait! Before you go  on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn’t done it?

Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren’t on the beat?

 The  ExxonMobil climate change controversy  concerns  ExxonMobil 's activities related to  global warming , especially their views on  climate change skepticism . Since the 1970s, ExxonMobil engaged in climate research, and later began  lobbying , advertising, and grant making, some of which were conducted with the purpose of delaying widespread acceptance and  action on global warming .
 From the late 1970s and through the 1980s,  Exxon  funded internal and university collaborations, broadly in line with the developing public scientific approach. From the 1980s to mid 2000s, the company was a leader in  climate change denial , opposing  regulations  to curtail global warming. ExxonMobil funded organizations critical of the  Kyoto Protocol  and sought to undermine  public opinion  about the scientific consensus that  global warming  is caused by the burning of  fossil fuels . Exxon helped to found and lead the  Global Climate Coalition  of businesses opposed to the regulation of  greenhouse gas  emissions. More recently it has expressed support for a  carbon tax  and the  Paris agreement .

 Early research [ edit ] 
 From the late 1970s and through the 1980s, Exxon, one of predecessors of ExxonMobil, had a public reputation as a pioneer in climate change research. [1]   Exxon funded internal and university collaborations, broadly in line with the developing public scientific approach, and developed a reputation for expertise in  atmospheric carbon dioxide  ( CO 2 ). [2]  Between the 1970s and 2015, Exxon and ExxonMobil researchers and academic collaborators published dozens of research papers. [3]   ExxonMobil provided a list of over 50 article citations from that period. [4] [5] 
 In July 1977, a senior scientist of Exxon James Black reported to company's executives that there was a general scientific agreement at that time that the burning of fossil fuels was the most likely manner in which mankind was influencing global climate change. [6] [7] [8]  In 1979–1982, Exxon conducted a research program of climate change and climate modeling, including a research project of equipping their largest  supertanker   Esso Atlantic  with a laboratory and sensors to measure the absorption of carbon dioxide  by the oceans . [9] [10]   In 1980, Exxon analyzed in one of their documents that if instead of  synthetic fuels  such as  coal liquefaction ,  oil shale , and  oil sands  the demand for fuels to be met by petroleum, it delays the atmospheric  CO 2  doubling time by about five years to 2065. [11] [12]  Exxon also studied ways of avoiding  CO 2  emissions if the  East Natuna gas field (Natuna D-Alpha block)  off Indonesia was to be developed. [13] 
 In 1981, Exxon shifted its research focus to  climate modelling . [14]   In 1982, Exxon's environmental affairs office circulated an internal report to Exxon's management which said that the consequences of climate change could be catastrophic, and that a significant reduction in fossil fuel consumption would be necessary to curtail future climate change. It also said that "there is concern among some scientific groups that once the effects are measurable, they might not be reversible." [15] 
 In 1992, the senior ice researcher, leading a research team in Exxon's Canadian subsidiary  Imperial Oil , assessed how global warming could affect Exxon's  Arctic  operations, and reported that exploration and development costs in the  Beaufort Sea  might be lower, while  higher sea levels  and rougher seas could threaten the company's coastal and offshore infrastructure. [16] [17]  Imperial included these forecasts into its facility planning in the  Mackenzie River  Delta in the  Northwest Territories . In 1996,  Mobil Oil , another predecessor of ExxonMobil, calculated the climate changes effect to the  Sable gas field  project.  An ExxonMobil spokesperson said that standard practice in major project planning is to consider a range of factors, and that ExxonMobil's consideration of environmental risks was not inconsistent with their public policy advocacy. [18] 
 In 2016, the  Center for International Environmental Law , a  public interest ,  not-for-profit  environmental  law firm , claimed that from 1957 onward  Humble Oil , one of predecessors of nowadays ExxonMobil, was aware of rising  CO 2  in the atmosphere and the prospect that it was likely to cause global warming. ExxonMobil responded to this claim that "to suggest that we had definitive knowledge about human-induced climate change before the world's scientists is not a credible thesis." [19] 
 
 Funding of climate change denial [ edit ] 
 Of the  major oil corporations , ExxonMobil has been the most active in the debate surrounding climate change. [20]   In 2005, as competing major oil companies diversified into  alternative energy  and  renewable fuels , ExxonMobil re-affirmed its mission as an oil and  gas  company. [21]  According to a 2007 analysis by the  Union of Concerned Scientists , the company used many of the same strategies, tactics, organizations, and personnel the  tobacco industry  used in its denials of the link between lung  cancer and smoking . [22]  ExxonMobil denied similarity to the tobacco industry. [23] 
 In 1989, shortly after the presentation by the Exxon's manager of science and strategy development Duane LeVine to the board of directors which reiterated that introducing public policy to combat climate change "can lead to irreversible and costly Draconian steps," the company shifted its position on the climate change to publicly questioning it. [1] [24]   This shift was caused by concerns about the potential impact of the  climate policy  measures to the oil industry. [1]   A study published in  Nature Climate Change  in 2015 found that ExxonMobil "may have played a particularly important role as corporate benefactors" in the production and diffusion of contrarian information. [25] 
 During the 1990s and 2000s Exxon helped advance climate change denial internationally. [26] [27]   ExxonMobil was a significant influence in preventing ratification of the  Kyoto Protocol  by the United States. [28]  ExxonMobil funded organizations critical of the Kyoto Protocol and seeking to undermine public opinion about the scientific consensus that  global warming  is caused by the burning of  fossil fuels . Exxon was a founding member of the board of directors of the  Global Climate Coalition , composed of businesses opposed to greenhouse gas emission regulation. [29] [30] [31]  According to  Mother Jones  magazine, between 2000 and 2003 ExxonMobil channelled at least $8,678,450 to forty organizations that employed disinformation campaigns including "skeptic propaganda masquerading as journalism" to influence the opinion of the public and political leaders about global warming. [32] [33]  ExxonMobil has funded, among other groups, the  Competitive Enterprise Institute ,  George C. Marshall Institute ,  Heartland Institute , the  American Legislative Exchange Council  and the  International Policy Network . [34] [35] [36]  Since the  Kyoto Protocol , Exxon has given more than $20 million to organizations supporting climate change denial. [37] 
 Between 1998 and 2004, ExxonMobil granted $16 million to advocacy organizations which disputed the impact of global warming. [38]  Of 2005 grantees of ExxonMobil, 54 were found to have statements regarding climate change on their websites, of which 25 were consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change, while 39 "misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence," according to a 2006 letter from the  Royal Society  to ExxonMobil. The Royal Society said ExxonMobil granted $2.9 million to US organizations which "misinformed the public about climate change through their websites." [39]  According to  Drexel University   environmental sociologist   Robert Brulle , ExxonMobil contributed about 4% of the total funding of what Brulle identifies as the "climate change counter-movement." [40]   The Drexel research found that much of the funding that direct sourcing from companies like ExxonMobil and  Koch Industries  was later diverted through third-party foundations like Donors Trust and  Donors Capital  to avoid traceability. [41]   In 2006, the  Brussels -based watchdog organization  Corporate Europe Observatory  said "ExxonMobil invests significant amounts in letting think-tanks, seemingly respectable sources, sow doubts about the need for [European Union] governments to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Covert funding for climate sceptics is deeply hypocritical because ExxonMobil spends major sums on advertising to present itself as an environmentally responsible company." [42] 
 In 2006, the  Royal Society  expressed "concerns about ExxonMobil's funding of lobby groups that seek to misrepresent the scientific evidence relating to climate change." [43]  Between 2007 and 2015, ExxonMobil gave $1.87 million to Congressional climate change deniers and $454,000 to the  American Legislative Exchange Council  (ALEC). ExxonMobil denied funding climate denial. [44]   ExxonMobil is a member of ALEC's "Enterprise Council", its corporate leadership board. [45] 
 In January 2007, ExxonMobil vice president for  public affairs  Kenneth Cohen said that, as of 2006, ExxonMobil had ceased funding of the  Competitive Enterprise Institute  and "'five or six' similar groups". [46]  While ExxonMobil did not identify the other similar groups, a May 2007 report by  Greenpeace  listed five groups "at the heart of the climate change denial industry" ExxonMobil had stopped funding, as well as 41 similar groups which were still receiving ExxonMobil funds. [47] 
 In May 2008, ExxonMobil pledged in its annual corporate citizenship report that it would cut funding to "several public policy research groups whose position on climate change could divert attention" from the need to address climate change. [48]  In 2008, ExxonMobil funded such organizations [49]  and was named one of the most prominent promoters of climate change denial. [50]  According to Brulle in a 2012  Frontline  interview, ExxonMobil had ceased funding the climate change counter-movement by 2009. [40]  According to the environmental advocacy group  Greenpeace , ExxonMobil granted $1 million to climate denial groups in 2014. [51] [52]  ExxonMobil granted $10,000 to the  Science & Environmental Policy Project  founded by climate denial advocate, physicist, and environmental scientist  Fred Singer [53] [54]  and earlier funded the work of solar physicist  Wei-Hock "Willie" Soon , who said that most global warming is caused by solar variation. [55] 
 In the fall of 2015,  InsideClimate News  published a series of reports on an eight-month investigation based on decades of internal Exxon Mobil files and interviews with former Exxon employees, which stated "Exxon conducted cutting-edge climate research decades ago and then, without revealing all that it had learned, worked at the forefront of climate denial, manufacturing doubt about the scientific consensus that its own scientists had confirmed." [56]   Exxon responded to the article by saying the allegations were based on cherry-picked statements from ExxonMobil employees and noting the ongoing climate research the company engaged in during the time in question. [5] 
 The company also denied claims made by  InsideClimate News  that it had curtailed carbon dioxide research in favor of climate denial. Exxon's statement said the drop in oil prices hurt oil companies in the 1980s and caused research cut backs. The statement also claimed that it was uncertain if increases in greenhouse gas emissions caused significant warming, or if immediate action on climate change was necessary. [57] 
 From 1989 till April 2010, ExxonMobil and its predecessor Mobil purchased regular Thursday advertorials in  The New York Times ,  The Washington Post , and  The Wall Street Journal  that said that the science of climate change was unsettled. [58] [59] [60]   In 2000, responding to the 2000 US  First National Assessment of Climate Change , an ExxonMobil advertorial said "The report's language and logic appear designed to emphasize selective results to convince people that climate change will adversely impact their lives. The report is written as a political document, not an objective summary of the underlying science." [61]  Another 2000 advertorial published in  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  entitled "Unsettled Science" said "it is impossible for scientists to attribute the recent small surface temperature increase to human activity." [62] [63] [64]   The  content analysis  of Exxon Mobil's and its precessors' internal reports, peer-reviewed research papers, and   advertorials  Exxon placed in the op-ed section of  The New York Times  between 1972 and 2001, by  Harvard University  researchers Geoffrey Supran and  Naomi Oreskes  found that "83% of peer-reviewed papers and 80% of internal documents [from Exxon] acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12% of advertorials do so, with 81% instead expressing doubt".  The research concluded that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. [65] [66]  The report was criticized by ExxonMobil and the  Independent Petroleum Association of America  because of the incomplete sampling of data collected by  Greenpeace , authors' involvement in the  #ExxonKnew  campaign, and partial financing by the Rockefeller Family Fund. [60] [67]  The IPAA also pointed out that Exxon and Mobil were separate companies during much of the period in question, noting that "[t]he climate research was done primarily by Exxon and the advertorials were primarily done by Mobil." [60] 
 
 Lobbying against emissions regulations [ edit ] 
 Lee Raymond , Exxon and ExxonMobil  chief executive officer  from 1993 to 2006, was one of the most outspoken executives in the United States against regulation to curtail  global warming , [68] 
 In February 2001, the early days of the administration of US President  George W. Bush , ExxonMobil's head lobbyist in Washington wrote to the  White House  urging that "Clinton/Gore carry-overs with aggressive agendas" be kept out of "any decisional activities" on the US delegation to the working committees of the  United Nations '  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), and recommending their replacement by scientists critical of the prevailing scientific consensus on climate change. The chairman of the IPCC, climate scientist  Robert Watson , was replaced by  Rajendra K. Pachauri , who was seen as more industry-friendly. [56] [69] [70] [71]  A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said the company did not have a position on the chairmanship of the IPCC. [72] 
 On June 14, 2005 ExxonMobil announced they would hire  Philip Cooney , four days after Cooney resigned as chief of staff of the  Council on Environmental Quality  in the Bush White House, two days after the non-profit  Government Accountability Project  release documents which showed that Cooney had edited government scientific reports so as to downplay the certainty of the science behind the  greenhouse effect . [73] [74] [75]   Thomas Friedman  wrote in  The New York Times , "Of all the people the Bush team would let edit its climate reports, we have a guy who first worked for the oil lobby denying climate change, with no science background, then went back to work for Exxon. Does it get any more intellectually corrupt than that?" [76] 
 Some researches say that ExxonMobil's strategy succeeded to delay the world's response to climate change, [77]  others are not sure if company's different behavior would brought a different outcome. [27] 
 
 Acknowledgement of climate change [ edit ] 
 In 2007, ExxonMobil for the first time disclosed to stockholders the financial risks to profitability of climate change. [18]  Even that, however, came only in the form of  boilerplate language in their  Securities and Exchange Commission   Form 10-K  citing the threat to operations and earnings posed by "laws and regulations related to environmental or energy security matters, including those addressing alternative energy sources and the risks of global climate change" [78]  rather than acknowledging the risks posed by climate change itself or by the company's contribution to it. [79]  In January 2007, ExxonMobil vice president for  public affairs  Kenneth Cohen said "we know enough now—or, society knows enough now—that the risk is serious and action should be taken". [46]  On February 13, ExxonMobil CEO  Rex W. Tillerson  acknowledged that the planet was warming while  carbon dioxide  levels were increasing, "but in the same speech gave an unalloyed defense of the oil industry and predicted that hydrocarbons would dominate the world’s transportation as energy demand grows by an expected 40 percent by 2030. [Tillerson] stated that there is no significant alternative to oil in coming decades, and that ExxonMobil would continue to make petroleum and natural gas its primary products." [80] [81] 
 In April 2014, ExxonMobil released a report publicly acknowledging climate change risk for the first time. ExxonMobil predicted that a rising global population, increasing living standards and increasing energy access would result in lower  greenhouse gas  emissions. [82] 
 ExxonMobil is dismissive of the  fossil fuel divestment  movement, writing on ExxonMobil's blog in October, 2014 that fossil fuel divestment was "out of step with reality" and that "to not use fossil fuels is tantamount to not using energy at all." [83] [84] [85] 
 Exxon routinely uses an internal  shadow price  on  CO 2  in its business planning. [86] [87]   In December 2015, following similar earlier announcements, Exxon noted that if carbon regulations became a requirement, the best approach would be a carbon tax. [88] 
 
 State and federal investigations [ edit ] 
 In May 2015  Sheldon Whitehouse  suggested in  The Washington Post  that the federal prosecution of the tobacco industry might set a precedent for the oil industry. [89]  In October, Whitehouse,  Richard Blumenthal ,  Elizabeth Warren  and  Ed Markey  issued a letter to Exxon questioning their donations to  Donors Trust , a group which funds climate change denial. [90]  On October 14, 2015,  Ted Lieu  and  Mark DeSaulnier  wrote to the  United States Attorney General  (US AG) requesting an investigation into whether ExxonMobil violated any federal laws by "failing to disclose truthful information" about climate change. [91] [92]  Asked about the letter by  The Guardian , an Exxon spokesperson said "This is complete bullshit. We have a 30 year continuous uninterrupted history of researching climate change..." [93] 
 On October 30, 2015, more than 40 leading US environmental and social justice organizations wrote to the US AG requesting a federal investigation into ExxonMobil deceiving the public about climate change. [94]  Former  Vice President   Al Gore  and all three  Democratic  primary candidates for  President of the United States  called for a  Department of Justice  investigation. [95] [96]   Marjorie Cohn , law professor at the  Thomas Jefferson School of Law  in  San Diego, California , called for the revocation of ExxonMobil's  articles of incorporation . [97] [98] 
 In 2015, the  New York Attorney General  launched an investigation whether ExxonMobil's statements to investors were consistent with the company's decades of extensive scientific research. [99] [100]  In October 2018, based on this investigation,  ExxonMobil was sued by the State of New York , which claimed the company defrauded shareholders by downplaying the risks of climate change for its businesses. [101] 
 Following published reports, based on internal Exxon documents, suggesting that during the 1980s and 1990s Exxon used climate research in its business planning but simultaneously argued publicly that the science was unsettled, the  California Attorney General  is investigating whether ExxonMobil lied to the public or shareholders about the risk to its business from climate change, possible  securities fraud , and violations of  environmental laws . ExxonMobil denied wrongdoing. [102] [103]   On March 29, 2016, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and the  United States Virgin Islands  announced investigations. Seventeen attorneys general were cooperating on investigations. Exxon said the investigations were "politically motivated." [104] [105] [106] 
 In June, the attorneys general of the  United States Virgin Islands  withdrew the subpoena. [107]   As of June 2016, ExxonMobil is suing the attorneys general of Massachusetts  Maura Healey . [108] 
 According to a 2019 article in  InsideClimate News  by  David Hasemyer , the  U.S.Supreme Court  found in favor of  Massachusetts Attorney General   Maura Healey  and allowed their case against Exxon to move forward. [109]  As a result of the SCOTUS decision, Exxon can no longer withhold records that the AG needs for their investigation into whether Exxon concealed that they were cognizant of the fossil fuels contributing to climate change and knowingly misled both the public and their own investors. [109] 
 
 Relations with the Rockefeller family [ edit ] 
 Beginning in 2004, the descendants of  John D. Rockefeller Sr. , led mainly by his great-grandchildren, through letters, meetings, and shareholder resolutions, attempted to get ExxonMobil to acknowledge climate change, to abandon climate denial, and to shift towards clean energy. [110] [111]  In 2013, responding to a shareholder resolution calling for emissions reductions, CEO Rex Tillerson asked, "What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers?" [112] 
 In March 2016 the Rockefeller Family Fund announced plans to "eliminate holdings" of ExxonMobil. [113]   The  Rockefeller Brothers Fund  and the Rockefeller Family Fund both backed reports suggesting that ExxonMobil knew more about the threat of global warming than it had disclosed.  David Kaiser, grandson of  David Rockefeller Sr.  and president of the Rockefeller Family Fund, said that the "...company seems to be morally bankrupt."  Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, daughter of former Senator  Jay Rockefeller , said, "What we would hope from Exxon is that they would admit what they've done -- these decades of denial..." [114]  In November 2016 ExxonMobil accused the  Rockefeller family  of masterminding a conspiracy against the company. [114] [115] 
 Kaiser wrote in December 2016, "Our criticism carries a certain historical irony. John D. Rockefeller founded  Standard Oil , and ExxonMobil is Standard Oil’s largest direct descendant. In a sense we were turning against the company where most of the Rockefeller family’s wealth was created." [116] 
 
 Other climate change activities [ edit ] 
 Beginning in 2002, ExxonMobil has invested up to US$100m over a ten-year period to establish the Global Climate and Energy Project at  Stanford University , which "would focus on technologies that could provide energy without adding to a buildup of greenhouse gases". [117] [118]  According to the  Union of Concerned Scientists , "The funding of academic research activity has provided the corporation legitimacy, while it actively funds ideological and advocacy organizations to conduct a disinformation campaign." [119]

 ^   Whitman 2015 : Croasdale said global warming could lower the costs but increase the length of time it would be possible to explore for oil in the Beaufort Sea, north of Alaska and Canada's  Yukon  Territory. He and his team of researchers had developed models that showed with climate change, drilling in the Beaufort Sea could grow from two months per year to as many as five, with costs cut by as much as half. At the same time, rising sea level due to climate change could hurt infrastructure

The documents, according to the environmental law center's director, Carroll Muffett, suggest that the industry had the underlying knowledge of climate change even 60 years ago. "From 1957 onward, there is no doubt that Humble Oil, which is now Exxon, was clearly on notice" about rising CO2 in the atmosphere and the prospect that it was likely to cause global warming, he said. ... Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, called the new allegations absurd. "To suggest that we had definitive knowledge about human-induced climate change before the world’s scientists is not a credible thesis," he said.

 Hearing held and Office of the Attorney General's motions granted in part. 
 State Court Dismissed Exxon’s Defenses Accusing Attorney General’s Office of Misconduct in Climate Change Fraud Action.  At a hearing on June 12, 2019, a New York trial court dismissed affirmative defenses related to alleged conflicts of interest and official misconduct in the New York Attorney General’s climate change fraud action against Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon). The court reserved its decision on Exxon’s defense of selective enforcement pending submission of additional documents. The court directed the parties to submit three-page letters on potential depositions of Office of Attorney General (OAG) staff. In addition, the court granted OAG’s motion to seal certain emails between OAG attorneys and a third-party attorney. The court also addressed a dispute over access to former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s personal email account, which Exxon alleges was used to conduct official business relevant to Exxon’s defenses. The court directed OAG to provide “a less carefully worded statement” to provide confidence “that anything that was official business or related to this investigation was made available” to Exxon “via communications sent by Mr. Schneiderman to his official account.”

 Oral argument on motions to dismiss affirmative defenses, to seal, and for protective order adjourned to June 12, 2019. 
 New York Trial Court to Hear Oral Arguments on Discovery Disputes, Affirmative Defenses in Attorney General’s Fraud Action Against Exxon.  The New York State Supreme Court scheduled a hearing for June 12, 2019 to hear oral argument on three pending motions in the New York attorney general’s fraud action against Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon). The attorney general alleges that Exxon deceived investors about its management of climate change risks. The first of the three motions that the court will hear on June 12 is the attorney general’s motion to dismiss five affirmative defenses that assert that the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) committed prosecutorial misconduct in commencing and conducting the underlying investigation of ExxonMobil; the attorney general alternatively seeks a protective order limiting discovery on these defenses. In the second motion, the attorney general seeks to seal five emails between OAG attorneys and a third-party attorney in which the third-party attorney provides information to the OAG about Exxon. OAG designated the emails as confidential in its production to Exxon. In the third motion, the attorney general seeks a protective order barring Exxon from deposing OAG attorneys. The attorney general indicates that the motion to seal and motion for a protective order should only be considered if the court does not dismiss the prosecutorial misconduct affirmative defenses. Other disputes have arisen in the course of discovery but are not yet the subject of motions, including a dispute over access to former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s personal email account, which Exxon alleges was used to conduct official business relevant to Exxon’s defenses.

 Court notice issued allowing attorney general to file motion to dismiss or to limit discovery. 
 New York Court Allowed Attorney General to Move to Dismiss Exxon’s Prosecutorial Misconduct Defenses in Climate Fraud Case, Said Discovery on Defenses Could Continue in Meantime.  On February 27, 2019, a New York trial court issued a notice allowing the New York attorney general to file a motion to dismiss certain defenses asserted by Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon) in the attorney general’s climate change fraud suit against Exxon. The attorney general contended that five of Exxon’s defenses that were based on allegations of prosecutorial misconduct were “inadequately pleaded and irrelevant.” In addition, the attorney general told the state court that the theory behind Exxon’s selective-enforcement claim had already been rejected by the federal district court for the Southern District of New York. In the alternative, the attorney general said it would file motion for a protective order limiting discovery in connection with the five defenses. Exxon opposed the attorney general’s request to file the motions, arguing that the motions were meritless and premature. Exxon said the attorney general could not rely on the federal court decision, which Exxon said did not consider the viability of the state-law defenses is asserting in this case. Exxon also noted that the attorney general had told the Second Circuit that it should affirm dismissal of Exxon’s constitutional claims because Exxon would have a full opportunity to raise objections to the state civil enforcement action. Citing federal and state court decisions in Texas that were generally supportive of Exxon’s theories and claims, Exxon also urged the court to reject the attorney general’s “cherry picking of judicial authority.” In granting permission for the attorney general to file its motion, the court noted that the parties “are involved in disputes in multiple fora and appear to have taken different positions on various issues in different courts.” Nonetheless, the court allowed the motion; the court also said Exxon could proceed with discovery on its defenses. The next conference scheduled in the case is on June 25, 2019.

 Conference held and motion for judicial disqualification denied. 
 New York Judge Denied Motion for Disqualification in State’s Exxon Fraud Case but Said He Would Sell All Exxon Stock.  On November 7, 2018, a New York State Supreme Court judge denied the New York Office of the Attorney General’s motion for judicial disqualification in the State’s fraud case against Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon). The attorney general argued that the case should be reassigned from the judge who had presided over the attorney general’s subpoena enforcement proceeding due to the judge’s ownership of Exxon stock. The attorney general contended that its waiver of disqualification in the earlier proceeding did not constitute a waiver in the present action. Although he denied the disqualification motion, the judge told the parties that he would divest all Exxon holdings by November 8, 2018. The attorney general’s office indicated it would not appeal the denial of the motion.

 Summons and complaint filed. 
 New York Attorney General Filed Fraud Action Against Exxon for Alleged Misrepresentations in Climate Disclosures.  On October 24, 2018, the New York attorney general filed an action alleging that Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon) perpetrated a “longstanding fraudulent scheme … to deceive investors and the investment community … concerning the company’s management of the risks posed to its business by climate change.” The lawsuit followed a multi-year investigation that became public after the attorney general issued an investigatory subpoena to Exxon in November 2015. In its complaint, the attorney general alleged that Exxon had made materially false and misleading representations concerning the proxy cost of carbon dioxide that it claimed to use to simulate the impact of future climate change regulations. In particular, the complaint asserted that Exxon made material misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts concerning “(i) its use of proxy costs in its cost projections, including in investment decision-making, business planning, oil and gas reserves and resource base assessments, and impairment evaluations; (ii) its consistent application of proxy costs; (iii) its use of proxy costs in its demand and price projections; and (iv) the risks to its business posed by a two degree scenario.” The complaint asserted a securities fraud cause of action under New York’s Martin Act, as well as causes of action for persistent fraud and illegality in violation of Executive Law § 63(12), actual fraud, and equitable fraud. The relief sought includes injunctive relief, a comprehensive review of Exxon’s alleged failure to apply a consistent proxy cost and the economic and financial consequences of such failure, damages, disgorgement of amounts obtained in connection with the alleged violations of law, and restitution for investors.

During the questioning Tillerson maintained that the company tried to understand the impact of climate change, and tried to accurately communicate the impact to shareholders. The former executive said that the company had no incentive to undercut cost assumptions. Tillerson served as Chairman and CEO of Exxon from 2006 to 2017, before stepping down to become the secretary of state under President Donald Trump. VIDEO 0:50 00:50 Former Exxonmobil CEO Tillerson wraps testimony in fraud case The Exchange Former  Exxon  CEO Rex Tillerson said the company tried to understand the impact of climate change, and tried to accurately communicate the impact to shareholders, as he testified on Wednesday in New York during the second week of a trial against the oil giant. The case, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, alleges that the company deceived investors about the true cost of climate change. The $1.6 billion suit is the result of a four-year investigation, and the first climate fraud suit to go to trial. Rex Tillerson, former chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp., arrives at state court in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2019. Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Exxon assesses the impact of climate change through a public proxy cost, as well as through a greenhouse gas cost. The former reflects the cost of climate policies that could reduce the demand for oil and natural gas, while the latter focuses on actual costs and expenses associated with current and future regulation. These costs are meant to show shareholders that the company is calculating the impact of climate change and waning fossil fuel demand on long-term projects. New York's case accuses the company of misrepresenting these costs. Attorney General Letitia James argues that Exxon used one set of numbers publicly, while operating with a less conservative forecast internally. She claims that Exxon was therefore deceiving shareholders since the company was making its assets seem more secure. Tillerson took the stand at 9:25 a.m. ET on Wednesday, and New York state attorney Kim Berger began questioning the former executive. The questioning lasted about 90 minutes, and focused on how the company reports carbon costs, and how the company factored increased costs from regulation into its long-term outlook. Under cross-examination by Exxon attorney Ted Wells, Tillerson once again said that the company took climate change seriously for years, and that the company created a systematic approach for how to factor in increasing costs. He said that climate change was one of the many risks the company had to manage, and that he supported a carbon tax as a regulatory measure since it could be adapted as the science around global warming evolves. When asked directly by Wells if the company would have any incentive to undercut cost assumptions, Tillerson said no. "When you become CEO you know you have to take a lot of criticism targeted at you. I feel bad for men and women at ExxonMobil Corp., because they are accused of a fraud as well. They are professionals, diligent, operate at high levels of integrity. Sometimes I wish I could step back in time and should not have put a plan in place. Maybe we should have stuck our heads in the sand," he said when Wells asked how it felt to be publicly accused of fraud. Berger did not question Tillerson about his use of an alternate email address while at Exxon. During the investigation, James found that in addition to using his company email, Tillerson also communicated through the alias Wayne Tracker. In 2017, Exxon lawyer Ted Wells said that "the purpose was efficiency, not secrecy." "Were it otherwise, emails to the Wayne Tracker account would have scrupulously avoided any reference to Mr. Tillerson as the intended recipient. Instead, numerous emails to the Wayne Tracker account are expressly addressed to Mr. Tillerson or contain his initials in the body of the email," his letter to the judge went on to say. The trial, which began last week, is the result of a four-year investigation. In 2015, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman first announced his investigation of the company. At that point, the charge was broader, claiming that the company knew about the impact of carbon emissions on climate change for decades, but covered it up. Since then, the case has narrowed in scope. It's now under New York's Martin Act, which is a 1921 law meant to protect investors from false statements from corporations, even if the company wasn't intentionally trying to be deceptive. "This is a case about the disclosures ExxonMobil made about its use of a cost of carbon to hedge against the risk of more exacting regulations and what a reasonable investor would have understood those disclosures to mean,"  the October 7 pretrial memo reads.  "By representing that it was applying higher projected carbon costs than it was actually using, ExxonMobil made its assets appear significantly more secure than they really were, which had a material impact on its share price. In so doing, ExxonMobil defrauded its investors under the Martin Act." Exxon denies the charges, saying the case is misleading, politically motivated, and the result of a coordinated effort by anti-fossil fuel groups. It says that the two costs were used for different purposes and should not be conflated. Tillerson served as Chairman and CEO of Exxon from 2006 to 2017, before stepping down to become the secretary of state under President Donald Trump. Justice Barry Ostrager is presiding over the case, and there is no jury. New York's trial is the first for Exxon, but there could be more to come. Last Thursday Massachusetts' Attorney General filed a suit alleging that the company violated the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. BP, Chevron, and Royal Dutch Shell are also currently facing lawsuits.

 ExxonMobil's climate-change accounting goes on trial

 A trial kicked off on Tuesday to establish whether Exxon Mobil, the country's largest fossil fuel company, lied to investors about the cost of carbon emissions to its business. 
 
 
 
 Exxon, long in environmentalists' crosshairs for trying to cast public doubt on climate science, is  accused by New York's attorney general  of misleading investors about how  climate change  will affect its business.  "This will only be the second climate-change case ever to go to trial in the United States," Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, told CBS News.

 Starting in 2010, Exxon began telling the public that it had assigned a price to carbon internally to model how government regulation would affect its business. However, it used two sets of figures: A high number that it presented to investors and a lower number in internal documents. Effectively, it was telling investors that its business decisions had fully considered the effects of future government regulations, when they had not.  The company made a number of oil-intensive investments, such as extraction in the Alberta, Canada, tar sands, that would have been dramatically less profitable if calculated with a high cost of carbon. Its dual sets of numbers also had the effect of discouraging investments in clean energy internally, because they appeared less profitable when the cost of carbon was low than when it was high. Exxon maintains that its use of several sets of figures is perfectly legitimate. New York is calling it fraud. "Exxon in effect erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate change regulation and had factored those risks into its business operations," the  lawsuit  claims. "As a result of Exxon's fraud, the company was exposed to far greater risk from climate change regulations than investors were led to believe." 
 
 
 
 How climate change could hit the financial system 
 If Exxon had used its carbon costs more truthfully, its reported revenues would have been billions of dollars lower, New York prosecutors contend, alleging that the company's misstatements cost shareholders between $476 million and $1.6 billion. It also accuses Rex Tillerson, Exxon's CEO between 2006 and 2017, of knowingly ignoring the alleged fraud. " Anyone in the investor and business community will realize that it's really serious when a company basically may have told its investors something that wasn't true," said Pat Tomaino, director of socially responsible investing at Zevin Asset Management. "It's a big no-no to tell your investors one thing and do another." Exxon said the lawsuit is without merit. "[It] deliberately  misrepresents a process we use to ensure company investments take into  account the impact of current  and potential climate-related regulations," the company said in a statement, explaining that the higher figure was used to represent the effect of all possible carbon regulations while the lower figure reflected laws actually in place. 
 Environmental activists rally outside the New York Supreme Court building in New York City on October 22, 2019, on the first day of a landmark case in which New York's attorney general is alleging ExxonMobil misled investors about the impacts of climate change.

 The company is facing a  multitude  of lawsuits, including from Rhode Island, Massachusetts and the city of Baltimore. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened a probe into Exxon during Barack Obama's presidency, but  dropped the inquiry  two years later after Donald Trump took office. 
 
 
 
 Any fine by New York is likely to be a drop in the bucket of Exxon's profits, which topped $20 billion last year. But a finding of guilt would send a signal to companies that New York intends to hold them accountable for climate change, including their disclosure of the potential risks. 
 
 
 
 Investors push companies to reveal their climate impact 
 A legal defeat could also dim Exxon's reputation with the public, said John Cook, an assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University. "This kind of court case is very powerful from a communications and storytelling point of view," he said. "That narrative — what Exxon knew versus what Exxon did — can create a simple narrative that the public can understand." One group that's paying attention: short-term investors. Last week, Exxon became the most-shorted stock in the oil and gas sector, with investors betting its stock price will fall, according to research from S3 Partners, a financial analytics and software firm. Among all companies, Exxon is the 20th-most shorted stock.

          CBSN Originals | Speaking Frankly: Dating apps
       
 
        Dating apps offer seemingly endless potential matches at your fingertips, turning an intimate experience into something that feels more like a video game. But because users hide behind virtual profiles, it's easy to ghost, harass, and view others as non-human — and now that bots are populating these platforms, some actually are. As the industry continues to grow, some experts question whether dating app companies are really interested in helping people find love, or if they have an incentive to keep people in an endless cycle of searching and matching without any real connection.

        After a recess, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff tacked on two more 15-minute sessions controlled by him and ranking Republican Devin Nunes.

 Understanding the #ExxonKnew controversy 
 ExxonKnew is a coordinated campaign perpetuated by activist groups with the aim of stigmatizing ExxonMobil.
Funders of the “#ExxonKnew” campaign have placed “pay to play” news stories, released flawed academic reports and coordinated with public officials to launch investigations and litigation, creating the false appearance that ExxonMobil has misrepresented its company research and investor disclosures on climate change to the public.

 What is #ExxonKnew? 
 #ExxonKnew is an orchestrated campaign that seeks to delegitimize ExxonMobil by misrepresenting our position on climate change and related research to the public. For the past several years, activist organizations have sought to bring investigations, shareholder action, legal action and protests against ExxonMobil despite the fact that ExxonMobil is committed and actively working to reduce the risks posed by climate change. 
 What organizations were involved? 
 The #ExxonKnew campaign is the outgrowth of a plan devised by environmental activists and class-action lawyers at a conference in La Jolla, California in 2012, as activists themselves confirmed in  The New York Times . The Climate Accountability Institute (CAI) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) held this workshop to brainstorm how they could use litigation to gain access to internal energy industry documents on climate change, in hopes of creating scandal that would force a settlement similar in scope to the one reached with Big Tobacco. They put their strategy into  a report  called, “Establishing Accountability for Climate Change Damages: Lessons from Tobacco Control.” 
 How was the campaign funded? 
 The #ExxonKnew campaign is extremely well-funded and includes paid media coverage, legal support, activist groups, and academic research. Foundations providing financial support for the campaign include: Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Rockefeller Family Fund, Rockefeller Philanthropy, Open Society Foundations, Energy Foundation, V. Kann Rasmussen Foundation, Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, and Mertz Gilmore Foundation. 
 What was the outcome? 
 In 2015, environmental activists and class-action lawyers succeeded in securing an investigation of ExxonMobil by then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, as originally envisioned in the  La Jolla report . The investigation was widely founded on claims that scientists and researchers from ExxonMobil knew that man-made emissions caused global climate change in the 1970s and 1980s, but that the company kept those findings secret. Contrary to their claims,  ExxonMobil's understanding of climate change  has tracked the scientific consensus on climate change, and its research on the issue has been published in publicly available peer-reviewed journals. 
 After over three years of investigation, during which ExxonMobil turned over four million pages of documents, the New York Attorney General’s office settled on bringing charges against ExxonMobil, not related to what the company knew about climate change , but instead obscure questions around ExxonMobil’s economic modeling and accounting practices, under New York’s controversial Martin Act statute.

 While those involved in the #ExxonKnew campaign have tried to claim their effort is based on investigative reporting by  InsideClimate News  (ICN) and the  Columbia School of Journalism  (via the  Los Angeles Times ), those stories were  bought and paid for  by many of the organizations listed above. 
 ExxonMobil’s continuous action on climate change 
 ExxonMobil continues to take action through research into technological innovation and by participating in constructive dialogue on policy options. We have pioneered research in advanced  carbon capture and storage ,  cogeneration ,  methane emissions reduction  and  algae-based biofuels , all with a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ExxonMobil supports a revenue-neutral  tax on carbon  and we  urged  the United States to remain in the Paris Climate Agreement. These actions demonstrate our commitment to reducing the risks of climate change.

 As Frumhoff says in a July 31, 2015  email , “we’re also in the process of exploring other state-based approaches to holding fossil fuel companies legally accountable – we think there’ll likely be a strong basis for encouraging state (e.g. AG) action forward, and in that context, opportunities for climate scientists to weigh in.”

 Dec. 22, 2016: Rockefellers forced to admit they directly lobbied Schneiderman to launch an ExxonMobil investigation 
 In  a column  published by the  New York Review of Books , David Kaiser and Lee Wasserman of the Rockefeller Family Fund admit: “It is up to government officials, not public interest advocates, to determine whether ExxonMobil’s conduct has violated any state or federal laws within the relevant statutes of limitations. Recognizing this, the Rockefeller Family Fund (RFF) informed state attorneys general of our concern that ExxonMobil seemed to have failed to disclose to investors the business risks of climate change. We were particularly encouraged by Schneiderman’s interest in this matter, because New York’s Martin Act is arguably the most powerful tool in the nation for investigating possible schemes to defraud.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
            2017
           
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Feb. 13, 2017:  New York Post  reports that the Rockefellers and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman were discussing the #ExxonKnew investigation before either the  InsideClimate   News  (ICN) or Columbia School of Journalism #ExxonKnew pieces were published

 April 6, 2017: #ExxonKnew campaign claims global warming caused the Exxon Valdez spill 
 This was  yet another article  written by graduate students at the Rockefeller-funded Columbia Journalism School, which was published in the  Los Angeles Times.  The article claims that ExxonMobil had evidence that the Columbia Glacier was calving due to climate change, but allowed one of its tankers to put itself in the way of the icebergs anyway. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 June 2, 2017: Schneiderman again changes the justification for his investigation into ExxonMobil 
 Schneiderman  shifted  from his original claim that the company was publicly trying to downplay the risks of global warming to a position that the company misrepresented how it was incorporating future climate policies into its business decisions, arguing that it may have inflated the risks climate change posed to its operations. 
   
 June 14, 2017: Court documents reveal Schneiderman used a private email address for official business while conducting #ExxonKnew investigation. 
 Court  documents , submitted by lawyers for the Energy and Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal), show that Schneiderman’s personal email address was used for official business because it is contained within a privilege log of correspondence that he provided to the court. A judge only recognized that the personal email was used after an in camera review of this log. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Aug. 10, 2017: Vermont Judge orders Vermont Attorney General’s office to disclose all email communications with Schneiderman’s office – including Gmail correspondence 
 Superior Court Judge Mary Miles Teachout  ordered  the release of records between the attorneys general of New York and Vermont, specifically any discussions of sharing documents with “outside advisors” pursuant to a secrecy pact. She also granted access to Vermont Attorney General Bill Sorrell’s private emails since both he and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman used private email accounts, specifically Gmail, in their  ExxonMobil discussions . 
   
 Aug. 23, 2017: Naomi Oreskes and Geoffrey Supran publish a study conceding that #ExxonKnew was never really about what ExxonMobil “knew,” but about punishing ExxonMobil for arguing against specific climate policy proposals 
 Of course, Oreskes is the activist that the  New York Times  has  credited  for helping kick off the #ExxonKnew campaign, whose goal was to  convince  “a single sympathetic state attorney general” to investigate the company for supposed climate fraud. If there’s any doubt about her positions ahead of releasing this report, in 2015,  Oreskes wrote:  “Did Exxon deliberately mislead the public on climate change? Hello. Of course they did!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 September 19, 2017: San Francisco and Oakland sue ExxonMobil and four other oil and gas producers.

 March 30, 2018: Judge Valerie Caproni, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismisses ExxonMobil’s First Amendment appeal against attorneys general Eric Schneiderman and Maura Healey. 
 Caproni  rules  that the evidence presented in the case, including the events that occurred at the March 29, 2016 press conference do not support ExxonMobil’s allegations. ExxonMobil appealed Judge Caproni’s decision to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2018. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 May 3, 2018: The New York Supreme Court Appellate Division upholds the lower court’s ruling in the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s (CEI) lawsuit against Schneiderman. 
 CEI sued AG Schneiderman after his office refused to disclose documents relating to the Common Interest Agreement that he led. In the May 2018  ruling , the court rejected Schneiderman’s claim that the common interest agreement contained confidential attorney work product, because the agreement did not contain any legal analysis and instead focused on global warming issues that were repeated from a press release issued by the NY Attorney General.

 August 29, 2018:  Justice Barry R. Ostrager urges the NY OAG to conclude its investigation. 
 At a hearing in the investigation, New York Supreme Court Justice Ostrager advised the NY OAG to end its investigation and either press charges against ExxonMobil or move on,  saying , “This cannot go on interminably. It's not my place to tell you when an investigation ends, but it is my place to put an end date on the requests for information and the filing of a complaint." 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 October 24, 2018: Attorney General Barbara Underwood ends the state’s investigation into ExxonMobil and files a lawsuit under the Martin Act. 
 The  lawsuit , following the more than three-years long investigation, claims that ExxonMobil misled investors by underestimating the risks climate change posed to its business in its financial disclosures.  
   
 October 25, 2018: The  Wall Street Journal  editorial board calls the NY AG’s lawsuit against ExxonMobil an “embarrassment.”

 Editorial boards and legal experts denounce #ExxonKnew campaign 
 Leading voices from across the country have denounced the #ExxonKnew campaign. From the  Wall Street Journal  to the  Washington Post , editorial boards have expressed first amendment concerns. 
 Editorials 
 Wall Street Journal 
 New York’s Climate Show Trial 
"The only reason New York has any chance to win this case is because it is using the Martin Act, the notorious New York statute that doesn’t require proof of fraudulent intent. The AG also doesn’t need to prove that an actual investor was deceived, only that a 'reasonable investor' might have been deceived. We doubt Ms. James cares all that much if she wins in any case. If she loses at trial, she’ll appeal to higher state courts to keep the publicity alive. And even if she loses every appeal, she’ll have done her political duty as a progressive and harassed a corporate sinner. If this legal attack doesn’t work, maybe another one will." (Oct. 21, 2019) 
 NY Post 
 The incredible collapsing ‘#ExxonKnew’ climate change lie 
“Which is why Schneiderman (before the revelation of horrifying personal conduct ended his career) was forced to find a different rationale: Big Oil, he said, might be ‘overstating’ its assets by ‘trillions,’ by failing to account for potential future regulations that restrict fossil fuels. Oops: The company had warned about the risks of new rules; that’s why a Securities and Exchange Commission probe cleared it of those charges. And the case that now-AG Letitia James takes to trial Tuesday is a huge comedown from even that claim, charging that Exxon fraudulently used two sets of books to state the risks. The company says it merely releases different estimates for different purposes, with full disclosure.” (Oct. 20, 2019) 
 Dallas Morning News 
 Exxon says there's a conspiracy against the company among environmental activists, and it's probably right 
 
“The narrative of an organic movement of environmental defenders taking on Big Oil has been depicted by some as a David-versus-Goliath showdown. But as more and more facts emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that Exxon has been unfairly maligned by a group of activists and lawyers driven by politics but bereft of facts.” (Aug. 3, 2018) 
 Wall Street Journal 
 AG Campaign is an 'Attempt to Stamp Out All Disagreement on Global-Warming' Policy 
 “Even with the fearsome power of the Martin Act, this investigation appears built for media consumption more than courtroom success. There are no “facts” about the eventual extent and impact of climate change that Exxon or anyone else can hide, because inside or outside the company there are only estimates based largely on computer models.” (Nov. 8, 2015) 
 Bloomberg View 
 Investigation is 'Dangerous Arrogation of Power' 
“Much as one may sympathize with Schneiderman's desire to encourage stronger action on climate change, this is not the way to go about it…Engaging in scientific research and public advocacy shouldn't be crimes in a free country. Using the criminal law to shame and encumber companies that do so is a dangerous arrogation of power.” (Nov. 10, 2015)  
 Washington Post 
 Exxon 'Didn't Commit a Crime,' science depends on allowing criticism  
“Legitimate scientific inquiry depends on allowing strong, even unfair, criticism of the claims that scientists make. As the Exxon investigations show, respecting that principle will not lead to positive outcomes in all cases. But it nevertheless demands that the government leave a sizable buffer zone between irresponsible claims and claims it believes may be criminally fraudulent.” (Nov. 14, 2015) 
 USA Today 
 ExxonMobil has a right to its opinion   
"Schneiderman's push is based on an extraordinarily powerful New York law known as the Martin Act. It only requires prosecutors to prove a factual error — not fraudulent intent. This is the type of law that should be used with great caution for critical public purposes. There lies the irony in using a law designed to protect investors to go after the oil giant. The investigation won't push Exxon to reevaluate its public stance on climate change so future investors won't be misled. The company did that years ago. And the most likely effect of a costly legal examination of Exxon's past statements is a lower stock price, hurting current investors." (Nov. 22, 2015) 
 
 Financial Times 
 Legal basis for AG investigation is flimsy, free speech implications are alarming 
 "The investigations launched by the attorneys generals of some U.S. states and the Virgin Islands set a troubling precedent for other policy debates, and threaten to undermine the cause that they aim to support…The legal basis for these actions seems flimsy…Beyond that, the implications of the investigations for free speech on public policy issues are alarming." (April 24, 2016) 
 
 Boston Herald 
 Healey should pull out of this foolish effort to basically try to regulate speech 
"Exxon can hire squads of lawyers to defend every statement it ever made about its research (they already are challenging Healey in court). The issue is moot today. The company cooperates with several carbon-reduction programs, supports a tax on carbon dioxide emissions and long has discussed climate risks in required financial disclosures." (June 27, 2016) 
 
 New York Post 
 Schneiderman's new claim in Exxon probe is a 'ludicrous stretch' 
 "Attorney General Eric Schneiderman must have hit a wall with his Exxon climate-change probe, since he’s suddenly changed his target.… Schneiderman’s new tack will only continue to politicize scientific debate and reinforce New York’s image as anti-business. It’s time for him to put the public’s interests before his own desire to please enviro-radicals — and end this probe for good." (Aug. 21, 2016) 
 Law Experts 
 Merritt B. Fox 
 Professor, Columbia University School of Law 
 
“The Martin Act grants the attorney general extraordinary powers to subpoena private documents without either obtaining a court order, which is required in most ordinary New York criminal proceedings, or the filing of a complaint, which is required in an ordinary civil action and is subject to court review. The Exxon subpoena is an abuse of these extraordinary powers […] At the extreme, the Martin Act subpoena power could be used to bully corporations into any kind of desired reform under the guise of a securities investigation.” (Aug. 15, 2016) 
 Philip Hamberger 
 Professor, Columbia University 
 
 “Mr. Schneiderman’s subpoena to Exxon Mobil thus stands apart. His ability to demand information in this way is a quintessential case of the fox guarding the henhouse. The threats to privacy in our society are not merely technological; they also are legal. In addition to electronic surveillance, nonjudicial subpoenas allow government to examine private documents as if they were an open book. And as shown by Mr. Schneiderman, when attorneys general can issue such subpoenas, a valuable judicial power becomes a prosecutorial threat to liberty and due process.” (May 11, 2016) 
 Dennis Vacco 
 Former Attorney General, State of New York 
"I was proud to play a major role in holding tobacco companies responsible for the damage they caused and in setting America on a healthier path. We had a clear, convincing legal case and a noble cause. The same cannot be said for attorneys general involved in the current crusade […] The tobacco companies were deceivers. ExxonMobil has been open. But that doesn’t seem to matter to the politicized attorneys general pursuing the company. A chilling impact on public debate is not in our collective interest." (July 14, 2016) 
 Harvey Silverglate 
 Civil Liberties Attorney; Member, ACLU 
“The Exxon investigation is “pure harassment [….]  It is outrageous for any law enforcement official to be seeking to win this battle for minds by flexing law enforcement muscle and trying to shut up the other side.” (June 16, 2016) 
 Tristan Brown 
 Professor, State University of New York; Attorney 
“In the interest of full disclosure, I should point out that I am in the camp that believes that climate change is occurring, and that it will ultimately impose tremendous costs on the global financial system as its impacts increase in magnitude […] That said, the Democratic coalition is pursuing a dangerous means of achieving its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Its unprecedented definition of fraud threatens to impose an undue and possibly unachievable regulatory burden on energy firms and their investors.” (June 21, 2016) 
 C. Boyden Gray 
 Former U.S. Ambassador to the EU; Former White House Counsel 
 
"The decision to single out Exxon is especially ill-conceived, because when it comes to actual proposals for real legislative action on climate change, Exxon’s advocacy has been indistinguishable from some of the leading environmental organizations. The Sierra Club’s former chief climate counsel has recounted how he and ExxonMobil’s climate policy manager “found common ground when we realized that we actually agreed on the best approach to climate policy” — namely a revenue neutral carbon tax — hardly the strategy one would expect from a company dedicated to covering up climate science" (Feb. 11, 2016) 
 Elizabeth Price Foley 
 Constitutional Law Professor, Florida International University 
“When the attorneys general used their prosecutorial power to investigate scientists because the scientists are not embracing an orthodox view of climate change or anything else — that is an abuse of prosecutorial power.” (Sept. 14, 2016) 
 Thought Leaders 
 Steve Forbes 
 Publishing Executive 
"On the very day in March when more than a dozen state attorneys general accused Exxon-Mobil of "fraud" and "deceiving the American people" on climate change, New York's attorney general, who led that news conference, met secretly with environmental activist organizations to discuss how they could attack oil companies. Email records show the New York AG's office urging activists "to not confirm that you attended or otherwise discuss the event" if reporters come calling. Exxon-Mobil won the first round in its fight against these coordinated state attorneys general in getting the truth-ignoring ringleader of this assault, who hails from the U.S. Virgin Islands, to withdraw his unreasonable subpoena. It should continue to take the fight to the other states that are coordinating with the green activists." (Sept. 16, 2016) 
 
 Kimberley Strassel 
 Columnist,  Wall Street Journal 
"The first thing to know about the crusade against Exxon by state attorneys general is that it isn’t about the law. The second thing to know is that it isn’t even about Exxon. What these liberal prosecutors really want is to shut down a universe of their most-hated ideological opponents… The goal of the Exxon probe isn’t to protect consumers or help the environment. It’s a message: Oppose us, and we will marshal our terrifying government powers to intimidate and threaten you, to force you to spend millions defending yourself, to eat up the time you’d otherwise use speaking out." (June 16, 2016) 
 
 Holman Jenkins Jr. 
 Columnist,  Wall Street Journal 
 "The premise of the assault on Exxon, the Journal, other campaigns against “deniers,” is worse than foolish. The climate crowd has turned to persecuting critics as a substitute for meaningful climate action because, as President Obama has acutely observed, voters won’t support their efforts to jack up energy prices." (June 28, 2016)  
 
 George Will 
 Columnist,  Washington Post 
 "Progressivism’s determination to regulate thought by regulating speech is apparent in the campaign by 16 states’ attorneys general and those of the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, none Republican, to criminalize skepticism about the supposedly “settled” conclusions of climate science […] The attorney general of the Virgin Islands accuses ExxonMobil of criminal misrepresentation regarding climate change. This, even though before the U.S. government in 2009 first issued an endangerment finding regarding greenhouse gases, ExxonMobil favored a carbon tax to mitigate climate consequences of those gases." (April 22, 2016) 
 
 Jon Entine 
 Columnist,  New York Post 
"The Columbia project serves as a warning: A premier university hires an activist to run its J-school. It partners with an activist online Web site to target an energy company previously savaged by its new dean in his book. The effort is funded by foundations whose role as fossil-fuel critics was hidden from readers. In the end, the journalists themselves wind up playing defense." (March 1, 2016)

 Meeting needs and reducing emissions 
 
 
                  The world faces a dual energy challenge: how to supply growing energy needs around the globe, while at the same time, addressing the risks of climate change. Key to solving this will be investing in and developing technologies to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy development. ExxonMobil today announced comprehensive reduction measures to accomplish just that.

 Flawed study claiming ExxonMobil misled public is disappointing 
 
 
                  ExxonMobil is committed to positive action on climate change and dedicated to reducing the risks in the most efficient ways for society. We’re focused on finding science-based solutions, which is what drives our research into lower-emissions technologies that can make a difference on a global scale — such as next-generation biofuels and carbon capture and storage. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has spent $8 billion in lower-emission energy solutions.

 ExxonMobil statement regarding New York Attorney General civil trial; October 2019 
 
 
 The New York Attorney General’s allegations are false. We tell investors through regular disclosures how the company accounts for risks associated with climate change. We are confident in the facts and look forward to seeing our company exonerated in court. 
 The New York Attorney General’s case is misleading and deliberately misrepresents a process we use to ensure company investments take into account the impact of current and potential climate-related regulations.   
 In the absence of a uniform, globally accepted cost of carbon, ExxonMobil uses two distinct metrics to account for the impact of current and potential climate-related regulations. The first is a “proxy cost” which is intended to reflect the impact of all climate polices that could reduce demand for oil and natural gas globally. The other, a greenhouse gas cost or “GHG cost”, reflects actual costs that might be imposed directly on the emissions of oil and gas projects as a result of specific laws in a jurisdiction, for example. 
 ExxonMobil applies proxy costs and GHG costs precisely as disclosed and takes both into account to help make sound business decisions and meet its fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. 
 It’s been well established that the New York Attorney General’s investigation and resulting civil lawsuit were politically motivated and resulted from a coordinated effort by anti-fossil fuel groups and contingency-fee lawyers involved in other lawsuits against industry.  
 The Attorney General’s allegations are the third legal theory put forward since starting an investigation into ExxonMobil in November, 2015.  
 As a publicly traded corporation, ExxonMobil files regular reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with its rules, including annual audited financial statements and other publicly available reports, such as the  Outlook for Energy  and  Energy and Carbon – Managing the Risks , which inform investors of the company’s strategy, approach and performance.  
 ExxonMobil believes that climate change risks warrant action and it’s going to take all of us — business, governments and consumers — to make meaningful progress. We’re focused on reducing our emissions, helping consumers reduce their emissions, conducting breakthrough research into lower-emission technologies, and supporting public policy, such as a uniform cost of carbon, to reduce emissions at the lowest cost to society. 
 Since 2000, ExxonMobil has invested about $10 billion in projects to research and develop lower-emission energy solutions, including energy efficiency initiatives, biofuels, flare reduction and carbon capture and storage. In 2018, the company announced greenhouse gas reduction measures that are expected to lead to significant improvements in emissions performance including a 15 percent decrease in methane emissions and a 25 percent reduction in flaring by 2020.

 The New York attorney general’s office Thursday dropped part of its securities-fraud case against Exxon Mobil Corp. on the final day of a rare climate-change-related trial that has pushed the oil giant’s accounting practices into public view.   Attorney general’s office lawyers withdrew two fraud counts at the end of a nearly three-week trial examining Exxon’s public and private estimates of potential climate-change regulations on its future business. But the attorney general’s office proceeded with two counts that require the...

 The Exxon Climate Scandal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Documents reveal that ExxonMobil has known since the late 1970s that its products cause global warming. A decade later, the company ignored its own scientists and financed a campaign to deceive shareholders and the public about the realities and risks of climate change. ExxonMobil now faces heightened scrutiny and growing calls to hold the company accountable for its deceptive actions.

 Yesterday, an industry-led task force issued  final recommendations  on how companies across all sectors should report on climate-related financial risks. ExxonMobil, which faced a  shareholder rebellion  on this issue at its annual meeting last month, could have seized the opportunity to welcome the recommendations and commit to improving its own reporting. Instead, the company released its  2016 Corporate Citizenship Report,  revealing that ExxonMobil continues to funnel more than $1.5 million to groups that have spread disinformation on climate science and/or seek to block action on climate change.

 Oil Industry Braces For Blowback From Exxon Scandal

 After years of anticipation, ExxonMobil goes on trial this week. The oil major has been under scrutiny for years by several state attorneys general over allegations that the company intentionally misled shareholders over its risk to climate change. At issue is what Exxon told its investors versus what it documented internally. The New York Attorney General argues that the oil company privately knew that its risk to climate change was much greater than what it divulged publicly. The question is if that gap amounts to defrauding investors. “Exxon in effect erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate-change regulation,” the  complaint  from the NY AG filed  last year  reads. Exxon engaged in “a longstanding fraudulent scheme…to deceive investors and the investment community,” the document said. For years, Exxon has assured investors that while climate regulation was likely, its oil and gas reserves would remain profitable to produce. The company has claimed that it has applied a proxy cost for carbon since 2007 and that its projects can withstand that cost. As a result, there was little reason to worry. Internally, however, the NY AG claims that Exxon did not apply that standard, and either used a lower proxy cost or none at all. ExxonMobil’s oil sands assets in Canada are of particular note, both because they were costly and because they are carbon-intensive. The lawsuit says that understating the climate risk meant Exxon failed to disclose $25 billion worth of costs. In one specific example, Exxon underreported $11 billion of costs for its Kearl oil sands project. InsideClimate News  published  a comprehensive backstory on the case last week. If true, the upshot is that Exxon is knowingly sitting on assets that might become stranded in a carbon-constrained world, and it simultaneously misled investors on that reality. Put another way, Exxon had two sets of books, according to the allegations, which obscured billions of dollars in potential costs.  The NY AG says that the “fraud” was sanctioned “at the highest levels of the company,” which includes former CEO Rex Tillerson.

It has fought aggressively to stave off the lawsuits, but the case brought by New York is the first to go to trial. Meanwhile, Massachusetts is pressing a similar case against ExxonMobil. The company has fought this case for several years, but state and federal courts have  allowed it to proceed . If the oil major loses at trial, it could be required to pay back “all amounts gained or retained as a result of the fraud.” More worrying for the entire oil industry would be the fact that a loss for Exxon could lead to a proliferation of litigation against oil companies. “It could open up a big can of worms,” Jennifer Rowland, an analyst at financial-services firm Edward Jones, told  the Wall Street Journal . “Other companies could be looked at and questioned about what assumptions they have made.” Litigation experts also  note  that Exxon is likely worried about the discovery phase of the case, which could unearth more damaging information about what the company knew and when it knew it. Again, InsideClimate News published a  bombshell investigation in 2015  that documented Exxon’s extensive knowledge of climate change, dating back decades, and also the company’s efforts to sow and manufacture doubt about climate science. The InsideClimate News report won a Pulitzer Prize. The story sparked even  more investigation  into oil industry’s role in obscuring the science behind climate change. In recent years, even as Exxon has fought to kill litigation, it has also struck a more measured public stance, advocating for a carbon tax and, more recently, opposing the Trump administration’s efforts to gut regulations on methane. The oil major clearly sees that climate denial is no longer a tenable position. But it continues full steam ahead on finding and extracting new oil and gas reserves. Exxon argues that it did not defraud investors, but its future survival is very much  contingent  on the world  not acting  on climate change.

									Pretty funny they use the Potemkin Village argument - classic move of the silver spoon socialist with their "eco" tours and "eco" this and that (the flyover set build their chateaus on mountainsides, sensitive ecological preserves and waterfront and then declare the surrounding "pristine wilderness" like the monarchs of old forbidding the peasants to trespass. "Potemkin Village" is the fantasy they sell to preserve their comforts while the rest of us pay for seminars to learn about the sacrifices they're willing for us to make. But the corrupt courts of the United States of America are as dangerous as any jungle - concrete or otherwise...
